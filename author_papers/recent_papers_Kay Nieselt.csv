"ProtEGOnist: Visual Analysis of Interactions in Small World Networks Using Ego-graphs.","2024","Comput. Graph. Forum","Nicolas Brich, Theresa Anisja Harbig, Mathias Witte Paz, Kay Nieselt, Michael Krone","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/cgf/BrichHPNK24","Visualizing small‐world networks such as protein‐protein interaction networks or social networks often leads to visual clutter and limited interpretability. To overcome these problems, we present ProtEGOnist, a visualization approach designed to explore small‐world networks. ProtEGOnist visualizes networks using ego‐graphs that represent local neighborhoods. Ego‐graphs are visualized in an aggregated state as a glyph where the size encodes the size of the neighborhood and in a detailed version where the original network nodes can be explored. The ego‐graphs are arranged in an ego‐graph network, where edges encode similarity using the Jaccard index. Our design aims to reduce visual complexity and clutter while enabling detailed exploration and facilitating the discovery of meaningful patterns. To achieve this, our approach offers a network overview using ego‐graphs, a radar chart for a one‐to‐many ego‐graph comparison and meta‐data integration, and detailed ego‐graph subnetworks for interactive exploration. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach on a co‐author network and two different protein‐protein interaction networks. A web‐based prototype of ProtEGOnist can be accessed online at https://protegonist-tuevis.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/."
"VIPurPCA: Visualizing and Propagating Uncertainty in Principal Component Analysis.","2024","IEEE Trans. Vis. Comput. Graph.","Susanne Zabel, Philipp Hennig, Kay Nieselt","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/tvcg/ZabelHN24","Variables obtained by experimental measurements or statistical inference typically carry uncertainties. When an algorithm uses such quantities as input variables, this uncertainty should propagate to the algorithm's output. Concretely, we consider the classic notion of principal component analysis (PCA): If it is applied to a finite data matrix containing imperfect (i.e., uncertain) multidimensional measurements, its output—a lower-dimensional representation—is itself subject to uncertainty. We demonstrate that this uncertainty can be approximated by appropriate linearization of the algorithm's nonlinear functionality, using automatic differentiation. By itself, however, this structured, uncertain output is difficult to interpret for users. We provide an animation method that effectively visualizes the uncertainty of the lower dimensional map. Implemented as an open-source software package, it allows researchers to assess the reliability of PCA embeddings."
"A temporally quantized distribution of pupil diameters as a new feature for cognitive load classification.","2023","ETRA","Wolfgang Fuhl, Anne Herrmann-Werner, Kay Nieselt","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/etra/FuhlHN23","In this paper, we present a new feature that can be used to classify cognitive load based on pupil information. The feature consists of a temporal segmentation of the eye tracking recordings. For each segment of the temporal partition, a probability distribution of pupil size is computed and stored. These probability distributions can then be used to classify the cognitive load. The presented feature significantly improves the classification accuracy of the cognitive load compared to other statistical values obtained from eye tracking data, which represent the state of the art in this field. The applications of determining Cognitive Load from pupil data are numerous and could lead, for example, to pre-warning systems for burnouts."
"Area of interest adaption using feature importance.","2023","ETRA","Wolfgang Fuhl, Susanne Zabel, Theresa Anisja Harbig, Julia Astrid Moldt, Teresa Festl-Wietek, Anne Herrmann-Werner, Kay Nieselt","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/etra/FuhlZHMFHN23","In this paper, we present two approaches and algorithms that adapt areas of interest (AOI) or regions of interest (ROI), respectively, to the eye tracking data quality and classification task. The first approach uses feature importance in a greedy way and grows or shrinks AOIs in all directions. The second approach is an extension of the first approach, which divides the AOIs into areas and calculates a direction of growth, i.e. a gradient. Both approaches improve the classification results considerably in the case of generalized AOIs, but can also be used for qualitative analysis. In qualitative analysis, the algorithms presented allow the AOIs to be adapted to the data, which means that errors and inaccuracies in eye tracking data can be better compensated for. A good application example is abstract art, where manual AOIs annotation is hardly possible, and data-driven approaches are mainly used for initial AOIs."
"BLASTphylo: An Interactive Web Tool for Taxonomic and Phylogenetic Analysis of Prokaryotic Genes.","2023","J. Comput. Biol.","Susanne Zabel, Jennifer Müller, Friedrich Götz, Kay Nieselt","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/jcb/ZabelMGN23","Identifying a protein's function is crucial to reveal its role in the cellular complex. Computationally, the most common approach is to search for homologous proteins in a large database of proteins of known function using BLAST. One goal of such an analysis is the identification and visualization of the protein in the taxonomy of interest. Another goal is the reconstruction of the phylogenetic history of the protein. However, the BLAST result provides information about the occurrence of the protein in the taxonomy and its putative function mainly in a tabular format. This requires manual interventions and makes the taxonomic identification laborious. Although various tools exist to visualize and annotate large-scale trees, none of them intuitively and interactively visualizes the protein's occurrence in the taxonomy for different taxonomic ranks. To target this gap, we developed BLASTphylo, a web tool that combines BLAST with automatic taxonomic mapping and phylogenetic analysis and provides the results in interactive visualizations. We demonstrate the functionalities of BLASTphylo in two case studies."
"GO-Compass: Visual Navigation of Multiple Lists of GO terms.","2023","Comput. Graph. Forum","Theresa Anisja Harbig, Mathias Witte Paz, Kay Nieselt","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/cgf/HarbigPN23","AbstractAnalysis pipelines in genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics commonly produce lists of genes, e.g., differentially expressed genes. Often these lists overlap only partly or not at all and contain too many genes for manual comparison. However, using background knowledge, such as the functional annotations of the genes, the lists can be abstracted to functional terms. One approach is to run Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses to determine over‐ and/or underrepresented functions for every list of genes. Due to the hierarchical structure of the Gene Ontology, lists of enriched GO terms can contain many closely related terms, rendering the lists still long, redundant, and difficult to interpret for researchers.In this paper, we present GO‐Compass (Gene Ontology list comparison using Semantic Similarity), a visual analytics tool for the dispensability reduction and visual comparison of lists of GO terms. For dispensability reduction, we adapted the RE‐VIGO algorithm, a summarization method based on the semantic similarity of GO terms, to perform hierarchical dispensability clustering on multiple lists. In an interactive dashboard, GO‐Compass offers several visualizations for the comparison and improved interpretability of GO terms lists. The hierarchical dispensability clustering is visualized as a tree, where users can interactively filter out dispensable GO terms and create flat clusters by cutting the tree at a chosen dispensability. The flat clusters are visualized in animated treemaps and are compared using a correlation heatmap, UpSet plots, and bar charts. With two use cases on published datasets from different omics domains, we demonstrate the general applicability and effectiveness of our approach. In the first use case, we show how the tool can be used to compare lists of differentially expressed genes from a transcriptomics pipeline and incorporate gene information into the analysis. In the second use case using genomics data, we show how GO‐Compass facilitates the analysis of many hundreds of GO terms. For qualitative evaluation of the tool, we conducted feedback sessions with five domain experts and received positive comments. GO‐Compass is part of the Tue‐Vis Visualization Server as a web application available at https://go‐compass‐tuevis.cs.uni‐tuebingen.de/"
"One step closer to EEG based eye tracking.","2023","ETRA","Wolfgang Fuhl, Susanne Zabel, Theresa Anisja Harbig, Julia Astrid Moldt, Teresa Festl-Wietek, Anne Herrmann-Werner, Kay Nieselt","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/etra/FuhlZHMFHN23a","In this paper, we present two approaches and algorithms that adapt areas of interest. We present a new deep neural network (DNN) that can be used to directly determine gaze position using EEG data. EEG-based eye tracking is a new and difficult research topic in the field of eye tracking, but it provides an alternative to image-based eye tracking with an input data set comparable to conventional image processing. The presented DNN exploits spatial dependencies of the EEG signal and uses convolutions similar to spatial filtering, which is used for preprocessing EEG signals. By this, we improve the direct gaze determination from the EEG signal compared to the state of the art by 3.5 cm MAE (Mean absolute error), but unfortunately still do not achieve a directly applicable system, since the inaccuracy is still significantly higher compared to image-based eye trackers."
"PTMVision: An Interactive Visualization Platform for Post-Translational Modifications of Proteins.","2023","EuroVis","Simon Hackl, Caroline Jachmann, Theresa Anisja Harbig, Mathias Witte Paz, Kay Nieselt","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/vissym/HacklJHPN23","In recent years, proteins have been shown to carry many more post-translational modifications (PTMs) than originally thought. The visualization of proteins along with their PTMs facilitates exploration and understanding of the effects of these PTMs on the protein structure, function, and interactions with other proteins. Therefore, we developed PTMVision , an interactive web-based visualization. We combine information about PTMs in the primary sequence with a two-dimensional representation of the protein’s tertiary structure using a presence-absence map and a modified contact map that relates PTMs with the spatial arrangement of proteins without the need of a 3D structure. The prototype of PTMVision is part of the TueVis Visualization Server and is available at https://ptmvision-tuevis.cs.uni-tuebingen."
"Resource saving taxonomy classification with k-mer distributions and machine learning.","2023","CoRR","Wolfgang Fuhl, Susanne Zabel, Kay Nieselt","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2303-06154","Modern high throughput sequencing technologies like metagenomic sequencing generate millions of sequences which have to be classified based on their taxonomic rank. Modern approaches either apply local alignment and comparison to existing data sets like MMseqs2 or use deep neural networks as it is done in DeepMicrobes and BERTax. Alignment-based approaches are costly in terms of runtime, especially since databases get larger and larger. For the deep learning-based approaches, specialized hardware is necessary for a computation, which consumes large amounts of energy. In this paper, we propose to use $k$-mer distributions obtained from DNA as features to classify its taxonomic origin using machine learning approaches like the subspace $k$-nearest neighbors algorithm, neural networks or bagged decision trees. In addition, we propose a feature space data set balancing approach, which allows reducing the data set for training and improves the performance of the classifiers. By comparing performance, time, and memory consumption of our approach to those of state-of-the-art algorithms (BERTax and MMseqs2) using several datasets, we show that our approach improves the classification on the genus level and achieves comparable results for the superkingdom and phylum level.

"The Tiny Eye Movement Transformer.","2023","ETRA","Wolfgang Fuhl, Anne Herrmann-Werner, Kay Nieselt","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/etra/FuhlHN23a","In this paper, we evaluate different small neural network models for eye movement classification and show our so far developed improved model architecture. For evaluation, we used a subset (1.5 million sequences) of the TEyeDS annotations since it contains in the wild recordings and has the most eye movement annotations to our knowledge. We classified fixations, saccades, and smooth pursuits with four different network architectures and the proposed model improves the equally weighted accuracy by 3.8% to the best competitor while only using 6% of the amount of learnable weights."
"Visual Linkage and Interactive Features of Evidente for an Enhanced Analysis of SNP-based Phylogenies.","2023","EuroVis","Mathias Witte Paz, Theresa Anisja Harbig, Dolores Varga, Eileen Kränzle, Kay Nieselt","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/vissym/PazHVKN23","AbstractMotivationA common practice in the analysis of pathogens and their strains is using single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to reconstruct their evolutionary history. However, genome-wide SNP-based phylogenetic trees are rarely analyzed without any further information. Including the underlying SNP data together with further metadata on the respective samples in the exploration process can facilitate linking the genomic and phenotypic properties of the samples.ResultsWe introduce Efficient VIsual analytics tool for Data ENrichment in phylogenetic TreEs (Evidente), a web-application that provides an interactive visual analysis interface for the simultaneous interrogation of phylogenetic relationships, genome-wide SNP data and metadata for samples of an organism. Besides visualizing the phylogenetic tree, Evidente classifies SNPs as supporting or non-supporting of the tree structures and shows the distribution of both types of SNPs among samples and clades of interest. Furthermore, additional metadata can be included in the visualization. Lastly, Evidente includes an enrichment analysis to identify over-represented genomic features encoded by GO-terms within the clades of the tree. We demonstrate the usability of Evidente with the data of the pathogens Treponema pallidum and Mycobacterium leprae.Availability and implementationEvidente is available at the TueVis visualization web server at https://evidente-tuevis.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/, it can also be run locally.Supplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics Advances online."
