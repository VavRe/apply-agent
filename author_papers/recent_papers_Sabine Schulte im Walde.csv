"A Dataset for Physical and Abstract Plausibility and Sources of Human Disagreement.","2024","CoRR","Annerose Eichel, Sabine Schulte im Walde","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2404-04035","We present a novel dataset for physical and abstract plausibility of events in English. Based on naturally occurring sentences extracted from Wikipedia, we infiltrate degrees of abstractness, and automatically generate perturbed pseudo-implausible events. We annotate a filtered and balanced subset for plausibility using crowd-sourcing, and perform extensive cleansing to ensure annotation quality. In-depth quantitative analyses indicate that annotators favor plausibility over implausibility and disagree more on implausible events. Furthermore, our plausibility dataset is the first to capture abstractness in events to the same extent as concreteness, and we find that event abstractness has an impact on plausibility ratings: more concrete event participants trigger a perception of implausibility."
"Semantics of Multiword Expressions in Transformer-Based Models: A Survey.","2024","Trans. Assoc. Comput. Linguistics","Filip Miletic 0002, Sabine Schulte im Walde","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/tacl/0002W24","Abstract
               Multiword expressions (MWEs) are composed of multiple words and exhibit variable degrees of compositionality. As such, their meanings are notoriously difficult to model, and it is unclear to what extent this issue affects transformer architectures. Addressing this gap, we provide the first in-depth survey of MWE processing with transformer models. We overall find that they capture MWE semantics inconsistently, as shown by reliance on surface patterns and memorized information. MWE meaning is also strongly localized, predominantly in early layers of the architecture. Representations benefit from specific linguistic properties, such as lower semantic idiosyncrasy and ambiguity of target expressions. Our findings overall question the ability of transformer models to robustly capture fine-grained semantics. Furthermore, we highlight the need for more directly comparable evaluation setups."

The tool supports standardized human annotation as well as computational annotation, building on recent advances with Word-in-Context models. Annotator judgments are clustered with automatic graph clustering techniques and visualized for analysis. This allows to measure word senses with simple and intuitive micro-task judgments between use pairs, requiring minimal preparation efforts. The tool offers additional functionalities to compare the agreement between annotators to guarantee the inter-subjectivity of the obtained judgments and to calculate summary statistics over the annotated data giving insights into sense frequency distributions, semantic variation or changes of senses over time."
"VOLIMET: A Parallel Corpus of Literal and Metaphorical Verb-Object Pairs for English-German and English-French.","2024","","Prisca Piccirilli, Alexander Fraser 0001, Sabine Schulte im Walde","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/starsem/Piccirilli0W24","The interplay of cultural and linguistic elements that characterizes metaphorical language poses a substantial challenge for both human comprehension and machine processing. This challenge goes beyond monolingual settings and becomes particularly complex in translation, even more so in automatic translation. We present VOLIMET, a corpus of 2,916 parallel sentences containing gold standard alignments of metaphorical verb-object pairs and their literal paraphrases, e.g., tackle/address question, from English to German and French. On the one hand, the parallel nature of our corpus enables us to explore monolingual patterns for metaphorical vs. literal uses in English. On the other hand, we investigate different aspects of cross-lingual translations into German and French and the extent to which metaphoricity and literalness in the source language are transferred to the target languages. Monolingually, our findings reveal clear preferences in using metaphorical or literal uses of verb-object pairs. Cross-lingually, we observe a rich variability in translations as well as different behaviors for our two target languages."
"What Can Diachronic Contexts and Topics Tell Us about the Present-Day Compositionality of English Noun Compounds?","2024","LREC/COLING","Samin Mahdizadeh Sani, Malak Rassem, Chris W. Jenkins, Filip Miletic 0002, Sabine Schulte im Walde","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/coling/SaniRJ0W24","The paper deals with the evolution of Russian unmarked indefi nite pronouns, also known as bare interrogatives, since the 18ᵗʰ century. The Russian National Corpus data suggest that the distribution of unmarked indefinites both in modern Russian and in the Russian language of the 18ᵗʰ–19ᵗʰ centuries is not in line with previous proposals. Surprisingly, unmarked indefinites are more frequent in some specific contexts compared to non-specific contexts such as imperatives or subjunctive clauses. I argue that the distribution of Russian unmarked indefi nites can be accounted for by some sort of economy principle: due to the lack of a marker of indefiniteness, unmarked indefinites tend to be used in contexts that are strongly biased toward a certain interpretation of an indefinite in terms of specificity (specific known vs. specific unknown vs. non-specific). This analysis, as I suggest, correctly predicts two typological tendencies reported on unmarked indefinites in the literature."
"Willkommens-Merkel, Chaos-Johnson, and Tore-Klose: Modeling the Evaluative Meaning of German Personal Name Compounds.","2024","LREC/COLING","Annerose Eichel, Tana Deeg, André Blessing, Milena Belosevic, Sabine Arndt-Lappe, Sabine Schulte im Walde","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/coling/EichelDBBAW24","We present a comprehensive computational study of the under-investigated phenomenon of personal name compounds (PNCs) in German such as Willkommens-Merkel (‘Welcome-Merkel’). Prevalent in news, social media, and political discourse, PNCs are hypothesized to exhibit an evaluative function that is reflected in a more positive or negative perception as compared to the respective personal full name (such as Angela Merkel). We model 321 PNCs and their corresponding full names at discourse level, and show that PNCs bear an evaluative nature that can be captured through a variety of computational methods. Specifically, we assess through valence information whether a PNC is more positively or negatively evaluative than the person’s name, by applying and comparing two approaches using (i) valence norms and (ii) pre-trained language models (PLMs). We further enrich our data with personal, domain-specific, and extra-linguistic information and perform a range of regression analyses revealing that factors including compound and modifier valence, domain, and political party membership influence how a PNC is evaluated."

"Classifying Noun Compounds for Present-Day Compositionality: Contributions of Diachronic Frequency and Productivity Patterns.","2023","KONVENS","Maximilian M. Maurer, Christopher Jenkins, Filip Miletic 0002, Sabine Schulte im Walde","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/konvens/MaurerJ0W23","We investigate the diachronic evolution of the frequency and productivity of English noun compounds and their constituents relative to their degree of compositionality. We focus on 185 compounds with human compositionality ratings and a range of quantitative information from a large diachronic corpus. We cast our task as binary classification, and show that both diachronic frequency and productivity are useful in determining the present-day degree of compositionality of English noun compounds."
"Investigating the Nature of Disagreements on Mid-Scale Ratings: A Case Study on the Abstractness-Concreteness Continuum.","2023","CoNLL","Urban Knuples, Diego Frassinelli, Sabine Schulte im Walde","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/conll/KnuplesFW23","Humans tend to strongly agree on ratings on a scale for extreme cases (e.g., a CAT is judged as very concrete), but judgements on mid-scale words exhibit more disagreement. Yet, collected rating norms are heavily exploited across disciplines. Our study focuses on concreteness ratings and (i) implements correlations and supervised classification to identify salient multi-modal characteristics of mid-scale words, and (ii) applies a hard clustering to identify patterns of systematic disagreement across raters. Our results suggest to either fine-tune or filter mid-scale target words before utilising them."
"Made of Steel? Learning Plausible Materials for Components in the Vehicle Repair Domain.","2023","EACL","Annerose Eichel, Helena Schlipf, Sabine Schulte im Walde","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/eacl/EichelSW23","We propose a novel approach to learn domain-specific plausible materials for components in the vehicle repair domain by probing Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) in a cloze task style setting to overcome the lack of annotated datasets. We devise a new method to aggregate salient predictions from a set of cloze query templates and show that domain-adaptation using either a small, high-quality or a customized Wikipedia corpus boosts performance. When exploring resource-lean alternatives, we find a distilled PLM clearly outperforming a classic pattern-based algorithm. Further, given that 98% of our domain-specific components are multiword expressions, we successfully exploit the compositionality assumption as a way to address data sparsity."

Using variants of BERT models and tokenization strategies on domain-specific restricted diachronic data, we introduce a suite of evaluations relying on the masked language modelling task and compositionality prediction. We obtain the most consistent improvements by pre-splitting compounds into constituents."
