"A Digital Twin of a Ball Screw Drive Under Different Conditions: A Case Study About Temperature Drift.","2024","ICIT","Zhibo Zhou, Michael Walther, Alexander Verl","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/icit2/ZhouWV24","The ball screw feed drive system (BSFDS) is a fundamental component of machine tools. Thermal error consti-tutes a primary factor contributing to the inaccuracies observed in models and, hence, the quality defects in the product. In order to decrease thermal error, traditional methods focus on the construction of a thermal error model and compensating algorithm. However, the warm-up phase is usually omitted, which can also have an influence on the behavior of BSFDS. The dynamical behavior of BSFDS in the warm-up phase is influenced by temperature and hence difficult to be described by a linear time invariant model. This research constructs a digital twin (DT) to describe the dynamical behavior of BSFDS in the warm-up phase. The digital twin is identified through the linear parameter variable (LPV) algorithm. To evaluate the algorithm, the constructed digital twins are initially validated on a simulation platform and then on a real-world experimental machine."
"A System for Reproducible 3D Ultrasound Measurements of Skeletal Muscles.","2024","IEEE Trans. Biomed. Eng.","Annika S. Sahrmann, Geoffrey G. Handsfield, Leonardo Gizzi, Jenin Gerlach, Alexander Verl, Thor F. Besier, Oliver Röhrle","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/tbe/SahrmannHGGVBR24","In 3D freehand ultrasound imaging, operator dependent variations in applied forces and movements can lead to errors in the reconstructed images. In this paper, we introduce an automated 3D ultrasound system, which enables acquisitions with controlled movement trajectories by using motors, which electrically move the probe. Due to integrated encoders there is no need of position sensors. An included force control mechanism ensures a constant contact force to the skin. We conducted 8 trials with the automated 3D ultrasound system on 2 different phantoms with 3 force settings and 10 trials on a human tibialis anterior muscle with 2 force settings. For comparison, we also conducted 8 freehand 3D ultrasound scans from 2 operators (4 force settings) on one phantom and 10 with one operator on the tibialis anterior muscle. Both freehand and automated trials showed small errors in volume and length computations of the reconstructions, however the freehand trials showed larger standard deviations. We also computed the thickness of the phantom and the tibialis anterior muscle. We found significant differences in force settings for the operators and higher coefficients of variation for the freehand trials. Overall, the automated 3D ultrasound system shows a high accuracy in reconstruction. Due to the smaller coefficients of variation, the automated 3D ultrasound system enables more reproducible ultrasound examinations than the freehand scanning. Therefore, the automated 3D ultrasound system is a reliable tool for 3D investigations of skeletal muscle."
"Adaptive Preload Control of Cable-Driven Parallel Robots for Handling Task.","2024","CoRR","Thomas Reichenbach, Johannes Clar, Andreas Pott, Alexander Verl","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2403-19293","This paper presents a method for dynamic adjustment of cable preloads based on the actuation redundancy of \acp{CDPR}, which allows increasing or decreasing the platform stiffness depending on task requirements. This is achieved by computing preload parameters with an extended nullspace formulation of the kinematics. The method facilitates the operator's ability to specify a defined preload within the operation space. The algorithms are implemented in a real-time environment, allowing for the use of optimization in hybrid position-force control. To validate the effectiveness of this approach, a simulation study is performed, and the obtained results are compared to existing methods. Furthermore, the method is investigated experimentally and compared with the conventional position-controlled operation of a cable robot. The results demonstrate the feasibility of adaptively adjusting cable preloads during platform motion and manipulation of additional objects."
"Endpoint Architecture for Distributed Real-Time Applications Based on TSN.","2024","WFCS","Stefan Oechsle, Florian Frick, Moritz Walker, Armin Lechler, Alexander Verl","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/wfcs/OechsleFWLV24","Distributed real-time applications perform deterministic tasks across multiple connected compute platforms, referred to as endpoints. Deterministic behavior of the communication and the compute are prerequisites, but coordinating and managing both in a holistic way is a significant challenge. Converged real-time networks based on Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) are considered the key enabler across industries for the required connectivity. To date, the potential of TSN cannot be exploited due to many sub-standards still being under development, gaps in the management and configuration functions, lack of best practices and unresolved integration with higher application layers and domain specific engineering. Previous work, focusing on a modular open source framework for the engineering and management of distributed real-time applications, identified a unified approach for TSN-based endpoints as a key gap. This paper presents a novel endpoint architecture to operate, engineer and manage distributed real-time applications by seamlessly integrating real-time networking and compute. The architecture provides interfaces to a central engineering, allows to integrate centralized as well as distributed network management and offers a unified data management. An abstraction layer for applications allows the efficient use and complements existing open source solutions."

"Learning Compensation of the State-Dependent Transmission Errors in Rack-and-Pinion Drives.","2024","ECC","Lukas Steinle, Valentin Leipe, Armin Lechler, Alexander Verl","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/eucc/SteinleLLV24","Rack-and-pinion drives are commonly used in large machine tools to provide linear motion of heavy loads over long travel distances. A key concern in this context is the achievable path accuracy, which is limited by assembly and manufacturing tolerances of the gearing components in conjunction with load-dependent deformation and the inherent backlash of the system. To address this issue, this paper presents a method for robust modeling of the individual and state-dependent transmission errors of a drive utilizing a two-stage machine learning approach. Based on this, the position control is extended to include an error compensation, which suppresses the modeled deviations in the mechanical system including the position-dependent backlash. The achievable increase in path accuracy as well as the robustness of the approach are evaluated and quantified by an experimental validation on a system with industry standard components."
"Modeling and Identification of Load-Dependent Properties for Electrically Preloaded Rack-and-Pinion Drives.","2024","ECC","Valentin Leipe, Lukas Steinle, Xabier Agirre Bikuña, Armin Lechler, Alexander Verl","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/eucc/LeipeSBLV24","Rack-and-pinion drives are preferred feed drives for long travel distances and heavy loads in large machine tools. One of the advantages compared to other feed drive systems is consistent stiffness regardless of travel length. A primary challenge with rack-and-pinion drives is the achievable accu-racy due to backlash. To compensate for backlash, electrically preloaded systems are commonly used in machine tools. In the case of electrical preload between two motors, the system is more complex to identify because the feed drive specific properties cannot be directly assigned to the respective drive train. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel method for modeling and identifying the load-dependent stiffness and damping of an electrically preloaded system. For this purpose, a mathematical modeling based on experimental data from a test bench with industrial components is presented to separate the drive train specific properties. This allows the system behavior to be modeled more accurately and used for control approaches."
"Modulation-Frequency-Dependent Power Dissipation Model for Servo Drives With Adaptive PWM.","2024","AMC","Manuel Weiss, Florian Frick, Armin Lechler, Alexander Verl","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/amc/WeissFLV24","The switching frequency of the power electronics in servo drives significantly impacts its power dissipation and process accuracy. To date, a constant high switching frequency is typically used, based on the strictest requirements of the manufacturing process. The novel adaptive PWM approach dynamically adjusts the switching frequency at runtime to reduce switching losses of the power electronics, while maintaining the required process accuracy. The switching frequency is set based on the requirements of the active operating state of the tooling machine. To determine the optimal switching frequency, a holistic understanding of power dissipation in servo drives is required. A novel modulation-frequency-dependent power dissipation model, incorporating the losses in the drive amplifier and in the motor due to current ripple effects, is presented in this paper. The new model is validated over a wide range of parameters, including different motors, voltages and currents. The evaluation of the model results in a better understanding of the modulation-frequency-dependent power dissipation in servo drives and enables the determination of the optimal PWM frequencies. It is shown that higher energy savings can be achieved at higher voltages, while current ripple effects limit the effectiveness of the adaptive PWM approach for motors with lower power ratings."

It has the potential to enhance the efficiency of manufacturing machines and reduce the frequency of errors. In order to fulfill its purpose, a DT must be an exact enough replica of its corresponding physical object. Nevertheless, the physical object endures a lifelong process of degradation. As a result, the digital twin must be modified accordingly in order to satisfy the accuracy requirement. This article introduces the novel concept of""learning digital twin (LDT),""which concentrates on the temporal behavior of the physical object and highlights the digital twin's capacity for lifelong learning. The structure of a LDT is first described. Then, in-depth descriptions of various algorithms for implementing each component of a LDT are provided. The proposed LDT is validated on the simulated degradation process of an anisotropic non-ideal rotor system."

"Deep Learning-Based Instance Segmentation for Feature Extraction of Branched Deformable Linear Objects for Robotic Manipulation.","2023","CASE","Manuel Zürn, Annika Kienzlen, Lars Klingel, Armin Lechler, Alexander Verl, Shiyi Ren, Weiliang Xu 0001","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/case/ZurnKKLVRX23","Branched deformable linear objects, like wire harnesses, are vastly used in the electrical industry to interconnect multiple electronic components while allowing small relative motions. Their deformable nature gives them an infinite-dimensional configuration space, which is challenging for robotic manipulation and requires sensor feedback about the actual configuration. Cameras have been used before in automation attempts as sensor feedback of branched deformable linear objects. However, image processing is sensible to occlusions and unstructured environments. This paper presents a method of using deep learning-based instance segmentation networks to extract topological features like connectors, clips, branch points and overlapping points on the branched deformable linear object. The topological features originate from features that can be used for matching a stretched representation of the branched deformable linear object to its sensor representation. Our results show that the network is capable of extracting the features for different datasets with high accuracy. Furthermore, this paper evaluates the use of preliminary results in the training process to facilitate annotation by predicting the labels. For now, this paper only uses 2D images of the branched deformable linear objects. Future work will also use depth images, such that individual deformable linear object features, such as length or radius, can be extracted from the images. We anticipate the usage of wire harness automation with robotic manipulation, augmented reality support of the worker or quality control of wire harnesses."

"Edge-Cloud Automation of Manufacturing Machines: Analysis of Potential Designs and their Impact on the Machine Performance.","2023","CASE","Marco Giani, Timur Tasci, Patrick Wiener, Alexander Verl","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/case/GianiTWV23","The migration of industrial automation systems to an edge-cloud hosted on factory premises can reduce the operation costs of a manufacturing line and increase its flexibility thanks to computation scalability and use of cloud-native operation concepts. One limiting factor in the realization of edge-cloud automation systems (ECASs) lies in its operation mode over the network. This may result in tangible delays between the industrial process and the edge-cloud. This paper analyzes how the network delay affects the process performance of an industrial machine on the base of the real-time requirements of the control functions hosted in the edge-cloud. For this purpose, two potential scenarios for the migration of the control system of a real machine to the edge-cloud are implemented. Each scenario features the offloading of more real-time critical control functions to the edge-cloud, which is then tested under increasing load on the network. The study derives classes of automation functions according to the real-time requirements of a potential offloading to the edge-cloud. Furthermore, it shows how complementary designs of an ECAS can affect the performance of the automated systems. In this sense, the results reveal that firm real-time functions can be offloaded to the edge-cloud without any significant loss of performance even if non-real-time networking components are used. On the base of these results, potentials applications domains of ECASs are discussed prospectively and future work is proposed."

Impending collisions of moving kinematics, such as robots, can therefore already be detected with the help of simulations before the production system goes into operation. However, changes in the control software of production systems that occur in the operating phase are often not secured, which entails risk, especially in the age of cyber-physical and adaptive production systems. This work presents a predictive simulation-based approach for the online collision avoidance of automated production systems by enabling virtual commissioning simulations for the application in the operating phase. This allows a cost-efficient way to achieve the safe operation of production systems without the need of additional configurations and sensors."
"Towards an Implementation of Simulation Based Digital Twins in Cyber-Physical Production Systems Environments.","2023","ETFA","Shan Fur, Samed Ajdinovic, Armin Lechler, Alexander Verl","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/etfa/FurALV23","The increasing digitization of the manufacturing industry offers a wide range of opportunities for the effective use of production data, which can lead to significant time and cost savings. One promising approach is the use of synchronous simulations during the actual operation of cyber-physical production systems (CPPS) to provide valuable insights into possible performance improvements and at the same time reduce the risk of costly downtime. This paper presents a novel concept that enables structured storage of CPPS production data as part of a digital twin that serves as a virtual replica of the physical production environment. In particular, this approach is based on the Asset Administration Shell (AAS), which provides a comprehensive framework for the management of production data and allows for a seamless integration with simulation models. Storing production data in a structured and standardized format can make data queries efficient, facilitate data processing, and provide a solid foundation for simulation model development, calibration, and validation. These simulation models can then be used to identify potential process improvements and test different scenarios, minimizing the risk of disruption to actual production."

Hoen, Anne-Johan Annema, Yanyu Jin, Jos Verlinden, Bram Nauta","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/jssc/DelkeHAJVN23","This article presents a frequency reference system that combines high frequency accuracy and low power consumption using a single-point temperature trim and batch calibration. The system is intended as a low-cost fully integrated crystal oscillator replacement. In this system, the oscillation frequency of a power-efficient, but process, voltage, temperature (PVT) and lifetime (L)-sensitive current-controlled ring oscillator (CCO) is periodically (re)calibrated by the well-behaved frequency stability of an untuned LC –based Colpitts oscillator (LCO), which is optimized for stability over PVT variations and lifetime (PVTL). During the single-point room temperature factory trim, the frequency of the LCO is determined and the result is digitally stored. An on-chip calibration engine tunes the CCO to the target frequency based on the LCO frequency, temperature sensor information, and digitally stored trimming information, thus effectively improving the frequency stability of the ring oscillator. The relatively high-power LCO is heavily duty-cycled to minimize the overall power consumption. A prototype fabricated in a 0.13- $\mu \text{m}$ high-voltage (HV) CMOS SOI process and assembled in a plastic package demonstrates an inaccuracy lower than ±93 ppm over a temperature range from −63 °C to 165 °C across 18 samples. The presented frequency reference system, including on-chip voltage regulators and a temperature sensor, occupies a chip area of 0.69 mm2 and consumes about 64 $\mu \text{A}$ from a single 3.3-V supply. The frequency error due to supply variation is roughly 92 ppm/V. The mean frequency shift due to aging, measured before and after a six-day storage bake at 175 °C, is only 52 ppm."

"Co-Design of Structural Timber Components Through Automated Model Generation for Manufacturing Simulation of Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems.","2023","M2VIP","Benjamin Kaiser, Alexander Verl","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/m2vip/KaiserV23","Manufacturing of products with high variability and small batch sizes, such as prefabricated timber building components, presents significant manufacturing challenges. In urban areas, the construction industry's relatively low productivity, coupled with rising demand for affordable housing and irregularly shaped spaces, calls for novel and innovative construction technologies. The method of computational design shows promise as a solution, allowing unique, optimized structures composed of individual components, departing from conventional modular construction. Automated prefabrication of these building components enhances construction productivity. Reconfigurable manufacturing systems offer a practical solution for addressing building component variations and changing project requirements, requiring frequent system re-configuration. The co-design process concurrently optimizes building components and manufacturing systems to ensure manufacturability and structural optimization through iterative design, validated by simulation. However, manual simulation implementation and validation for component manufacturability is time-consuming and error-prone, especially considering the numerous iterations and layout variants involved in the co-design process. This paper proposes a method for automatically generating and conducting simulations to check the manufacturability of building elements to enable co-design. The proposed method uses AutomationML as a modeling language for describing the manufacturing system and building components. We conduct several simulations with parametrically generated timber shell elements to validate the proposed method."

High flexibility and high throughput are expected, combined with high availability and efficient operation. To meet these requirements, this paper presents a novel intralogistics system based on the functionality of a planar motor. Following the operating principle of a moving stator, the vehicles are entirely passive and the hardware for the generation of motion is integrated into the floor. This is achieved in the form of compact, decentrally interconnected floor units, several of which are simultaneously involved in a motion. In order to control this system with satisfactory reliability and performance, the theoretical foundations for a proper understanding of the system are examined before a system model is derived and parameterized through measurements. On this basis a specifically designed motion control system is developed, that features precise planar movement, decentralized computation and compensation of position dependent characteristics. Thereafter, a method for model-based parameterization is outlined, that takes into account robustness against disturbances and parameter variations. Finally, the developed approach is implemented on the actual hardware and validated in experimental investigations in terms of path accuracy."

A programmable logic controller (PLC) is no longer a closed system but extensively offers interfaces to the outside. The trends towards decentralization, highly flexible systems, and a flattening of the automation pyramid create new requirements that classic control architectures need to meet. In this context, a high degree of integration between components with simultaneous temporal and spatial isolation is crucial. This paper addresses the conception of an isolation mechanism for the extension of the control functionality by value-added services. The basis for this is a combination of a partitioning hypervisor and software containers, which was chosen based on an evaluation of current isolation mechanisms for container solutions. Different messaging-based approaches with a common API for communication between components are developed and evaluated."

"Topology Matching of Branched Deformable Linear Objects.","2023","ICRA","Manuel Zürn, Markus Wnuk, Armin Lechler, Alexander Verl","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/icra/ZurnWLV23","This paper presents a new method for correspondence estimation between a previously known topology of a branched deformable linear object and an image representation from a 3D stereo camera. Although frequently encountered in production, robotic deformable linear object manipulation still lacks reliable sensor feedback. Especially for branched deformable linear objects, such as wire harnesses, correspondence estimation is very challenging. Due to their flexible nature, they have an infinite-dimensional configuration space, such that visual appearances of the same object can vary strongly. Knowing the correspondence is vital for various applications, e.g., estimating valid grasping positions for robotic wire routing or augmented reality support for workers. Therefore, this paper presents a method for matching the topology of a branched deformable linear object to camera sensor data. Asymmetries in the wire harness design reduce the solution space by comparing the known topology of a model to the topology extracted from sensor data. The problem of finding the most likely solution to the matching problem requires features extracted from camera images. These features are used to construct a graph-based topology representation, which can then be matched to a graph-based topology representation of the known branched deformable linear object. The presented method is evaluated using multiple different non-overlapping configurations of a wire harness, showing the effectiveness of a graph-based segment matching approach."
