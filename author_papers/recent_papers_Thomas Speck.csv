"3D-printed digital pneumatic logic for the control of soft robotic actuators.","2024","Sci. Robotics","Stefan Conrad 0004, Joscha Teichmann, Philipp Auth, N. Knorr, Kim Ulrich, D. Bellin, Thomas Speck, Falk J. Tauber","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/scirobotics/ConradTAKUBST24","Soft robots are paving their way to catch up with the application range of metal-based machines and to occupy fields that are challenging for traditional machines. Pneumatic actuators play an important role in this development, allowing the construction of bioinspired motion systems. Pneumatic logic gates provide a powerful alternative for controlling pressure-activated soft robots, which are often controlled by metallic valves and electric circuits. Many existing approaches for fully compliant pneumatic control logic suffer from high manual effort and low pressure tolerance. In our work, we invented three-dimensional (3D) printable, pneumatic logic gates that perform Boolean operations and imitate electric circuits. Within 7 hours, a filament printer is able to produce a module that serves as an OR, AND, or NOT gate; the logic function is defined by the assigned input signals. The gate contains two alternately acting pneumatic valves, whose work principle is based on the interaction of pressurized chambers and a 3D-printed 1-millimeter tube inside. The gate design does not require any kind of support material for its hollow parts, which makes the modules ready to use directly after printing. Depending on the chosen material, the modules can operate on a pressure supply between 80 and more than 750 kilopascals. The capabilities of the invented gates were verified by implementing an electronics-free drink dispenser based on a pneumatic ring oscillator and a 1-bit memory. Their high compliance is demonstrated by driving a car over a fully flexible, 3D-printed robotic walker controlled by an integrated circuit."

"Adaptive time step selection for Spectral Deferred Corrections.","2024","CoRR","Thomas Baumann, Sebastian Götschel, Thibaut Lunet, Daniel Ruprecht, Robert Speck","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2403-13454","Spectral Deferred Correction (SDC) is an iterative method for the numerical solution of ordinary differential equations. It works by refining the numerical solution for an initial value problem by approximately solving differential equations for the error, and can be interpreted as a preconditioned fixed-point iteration for solving the fully implicit collocation problem. We adopt techniques from embedded Runge-Kutta Methods (RKM) to SDC in order to provide a mechanism for adaptive time step size selection and thus increase computational efficiency of SDC. We propose two SDC-specific estimates of the local error that are generic and do not rely on problem specific quantities. We demonstrate a gain in efficiency over standard SDC with fixed step size and compare efficiency favorably against state-of-the-art adaptive RKM."
"Towards High Resolution Absolute Angle Sensing using Dual-Wavelength Laser Speckle.","2024","I2MTC","Sam J. Gibson, Thomas O. H. Charrett, Ralph P. Tatam","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/i2mtc/GibsonCT24","We present a two dimensional angle sensor with greater than 0.01 degrees resolution, using dual-wavelength laser speckle. The technique uses speckle correlation of a double speckle pattern, determining absolute surface tilt from a single frame. A constructed sensor was used to measure a grid of 2D angles between $\pm 0.25^{\circ}$ rotating around both $x$ and $y$ axes. Sensor performance was limited by laser mode instability effects, however an analysis of measurements demonstrated that a stable mode output could achieve bias errors of less than 0.010°, and standard deviations of 0.003° around $x$ and 0.021° around $y$."
"Tracking and navigation of a microswarm under laser speckle contrast imaging for targeted delivery.","2024","Sci.

However, in vivo real-time imaging and tracking of micro/nanorobotic swarms remain a challenge, considering the limited imaging size and spatial-temporal resolution of current imaging modalities. Here, we propose a strategy that enables real-time tracking and navigation of a microswarm in stagnant and flowing blood environments by using laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI), featuring full-field imaging, high temporal-spatial resolution, and noninvasiveness. The change in dynamic convection induced by the microswarm can be quantitatively investigated by analyzing the perfusion unit (PU) distribution, offering an alternative approach to investigate the swarm behavior and its interaction with various blood environments. Both the microswarm and surrounding environment were monitored and imaged by LSCI in real time, and the images were further analyzed for simultaneous swarm tracking and navigation in the complex vascular system. Moreover, our strategy realized real-time tracking and delivery of a microswarm in vivo, showing promising potential for LSCI-guided active delivery of microswarm in the vascular system. Laser speckle contrast imaging guides real-time tracking and navigation of a microswarm for targeted delivery in vivo. Editor’s summary Micro- and nanorobots have been widely proposed for various medical applications, including drug delivery and thrombolysis. However, tracking these swarms of robots in real time has been challenging, especially for imaging modalities that rely on extended exposure to ionizing radiation. Wang et al. report on the use of laser speckle contrast imaging to track a swarm of magnetic nanorobots within blood vessels in real time and guide their endovascular navigation. The authors demonstrated the potential for high contrast imaging and navigation of the swarm of nanorobots in stagnant and flowing blood environments ex vivo and in vivo. The findings offer an opportunity for improvements in targeted endovascular delivery. —Amos Matsiko"
"UPAR Challenge 2024: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition and Attribute-Based Person Retrieval - Dataset, Design, and Results.","2024","WACV","Mickael Cormier, Andreas Specker, Júlio C. S. Jacques Júnior, Lennart Moritz, Jürgen Metzler, Thomas B. Moeslund, Kamal Nasrollahi, Sergio Escalera, Jürgen Beyerer","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/wacv/CormierSJMMMNEB24","Attribute-based person retrieval enables individuals to be searched and retrieved using their soft biometric features, for instance, gender, accessories, and clothing colors. The process has numerous practical use cases, such as surveillance, retail, or smart cities. Notably, attribute-based person retrieval empowers law enforcement agencies to efficiently comb through vast volumes of surveillance footage from extensive multi-camera networks, facilitating the swift localization of missing persons or criminals. However, for real-world application, attribute-based person retrieval is required to generalize to multiple settings in indoor and outdoor scenarios with their respective challenges. For its second edition, the WACV 2024 Pedestrian Attribute Recognition and Attribute-based Person Retrieval Challenge (UPAR-Challenge) aimed once again to spotlight the current challenges and limitations of existing methods to bridge the domain gaps in real-world surveillance contexts. Analogous to the first edition, two tracks are offered: pedestrian attribute recognition and attribute-based person retrieval. The UPAR-Challenge 2024 dataset extends the UPAR dataset with the introduction of harmonized annotations for the MEVID dataset, which is used as a novel test domain. To this aim, 1.1M additional annotations were manually labeled and validated. Each track evaluates the robustness of the competing methods to domain shifts by training and evaluating on data from entirely different domains. The challenge attracted 82 registered participants, which was considered a success from the organiz ers' perspective. While ten competing teams surpassed the baseline for track 1, no team managed to outperform the baseline on track 2, emphasizing the task's difficulty. This work describes the challenge design, the adopted dataset, obtained results, as well as future directions on the topic.

"Design and Application of Safety Filters to Secure Controllers in Autonomous Driving.","2023","ACC","Pascal Jaufmann, Adrian Trachte, Felix Berkel, Thomas Specker, Oliver Sawodny","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/amcc/JaufmannTBSS23","The ability to guarantee safety for a given controller is becoming more and more important in the field of autonomous driving. In this paper, we design, implement and compare two safety methods, capable of providing safety for an arbitrary input signal. Possible unsafe controllers ranging from learning algorithms to unknown controllers from an OEM can thus be safely applied to the system. The presented robust model predictive safety filter, based upon an MPC framework, searches for a safe and minimally invasive input. Hence, an algorithm certifying whether the desired control signal is safe or must be altered in order to maintain safety is used. By applying the design to a single track model and the scenario of a double lane-change, the filter shows its capability to provide safety for a badly tuned PID controller. The MPC approach is compared to an invariant set filter that employs a safe control set to keep the vehicle within constraints, identifying the main differences. Additionally, the robust model predictive safety filter scheme successfully ensures safe driving under additive disturbances."

The time separation technique (TST) has been successfully used for modelling C-arm cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) perfusion data. The reconstruction can be accompanied by the segmentation of the liver - for better visualisation and for generating comprehensive perfusion maps. Recently introduced Turbolift learning has been seen to perform well while working with TST reconstructions, but has not been explored for the time-resolved volumes (TRV) estimated out of TST reconstructions. The segmentation of the TRVs can be useful for tracking the movement of the liver over time. This research explores this possibility by training the multi-scale attention UNet of Turbolift learning at its third stage on the TRVs and shows the robustness of Turbolift learning since it can even work efficiently with the TRVs, resulting in a Dice score of $0.864\pm 0.004$."
