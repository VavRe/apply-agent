"Deep Medial Voxels: Learned Medial Axis Approximations for Anatomical Shape Modeling.","2024","CoRR","Antonio Pepe 0003, Richard Schussnig, Jianning Li, Christina Gsaxner, Dieter Schmalstieg, Jan Egger","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2403-11790","Shape reconstruction from imaging volumes is a recurring need in medical image analysis. Common workflows start with a segmentation step, followed by careful post-processing and,finally, ad hoc meshing algorithms. As this sequence can be timeconsuming, neural networks are trained to reconstruct shapes through template deformation. These networks deliver state-ofthe-art results without manual intervention, but, so far, they have primarily been evaluated on anatomical shapes with little topological variety between individuals. In contrast, other works favor learning implicit shape models, which have multiple benefits for meshing and visualization. Our work follows this direction by introducing deep medial voxels, a semi-implicit representation that faithfully approximates the topological skeleton from imaging volumes and eventually leads to shape reconstruction via convolution surfaces. Our reconstruction technique shows potential for both visualization and computer simulations."

"Design Patterns for Situated Visualization in Augmented Reality.","2024","IEEE Trans. Vis. Comput. Graph.","Benjamin Lee, Michael Sedlmair, Dieter Schmalstieg","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/tvcg/LeeSS24","Situated visualization has become an increasingly popular research area in the visualization community, fueled by advancements in augmented reality (AR) technology and immersive analytics. Visualizing data in spatial proximity to their physical referents affords new design opportunities and considerations not present in traditional visualization, which researchers are now beginning to explore. However, the AR research community has an extensive history of designing graphics that are displayed in highly physical contexts. In this work, we leverage the richness of AR research and apply it to situated visualization. We derive design patterns which summarize common approaches of visualizing data in situ. The design patterns are based on a survey of 293 papers published in the AR and visualization communities, as well as our own expertise. We discuss design dimensions that help to describe both our patterns and previous work in the literature. This discussion is accompanied by several guidelines which explain how to apply the patterns given the constraints imposed by the real world. We conclude by discussing future research directions that will help establish a complete understanding of the design of situated visualization, including the role of interactivity, tasks, and workflows."
"End-to-End Compressed Meshlet Rendering.","2024","Comput. Graph. Forum","Daniel Mlakar, Markus Steinberger, Dieter Schmalstieg","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/cgf/MlakarSS24","In this paper, we study rendering of end‐to‐end compressed triangle meshes using modern GPU techniques, in particular, mesh shaders. Our approach allows us to keep unstructured triangle meshes in GPU memory in compressed form and decompress them in shader code just in time for rasterization. Typical previous approaches use a compressed mesh format only for persistent storage and streaming, but must decompress it into GPU memory before submitting it to rendering. In contrast, our approach uses an identical compressed format in both storage and GPU memory. Hence, our compression method effectively reduces the in‐memory requirements of huge triangular meshes and avoids any waiting times on streaming geometry induced by the need for a decompression stage on the CPU. End‐to‐end compression also means that scenes with more geometric detail than previously possible can be made fully resident in GPU memory. Our approach is based on a novel decomposition of meshes into meshlets, i.e. disjoint primitive groups that are compressed individually. Decompression using a mesh shader allows de facto random access on the primitive level, which is important for applications such as selective streaming and fine‐grained visibility computation. We compare our approach to multiple commonly used compressed meshlet formats in terms of required memory and rendering times. The results imply that our approach reduces the required CPU–GPU memory bandwidth, a frequent bottleneck in out‐of‐core rendering."

Specifically, we conducted a day long workshop in the French city of Bordeaux where we envisioned situated visualizations of urban environmental footprints. We explored the city and took photos and notes about possible situated visualizations of environmental footprints that could be embedded near places, people, or objects of interest. We found that our designs targeted four purposes and used four different methods that could be further explored to test situated visualizations for the protection of the environment."
"Higher-order block-structured hex meshing of tubular structures.","2024","Eng. Comput.","Domagoj Bosnjak, Antonio Pepe 0003, Richard Schussnig, Dieter Schmalstieg, Thomas-Peter Fries","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/ewc/BosnjakPSSF24","AbstractNumerical simulations of the cardiovascular system are growing in popularity due to the increasing availability of computational power, and their proven contribution to the understanding of pathodynamics and validation of medical devices with in-silico trials as a potential future breakthrough. Such simulations are performed on volumetric meshes reconstructed from patient-specific imaging data. These meshes are most often unstructured, and result in a brutally large amount of elements, significantly increasing the computational complexity of the simulations, whilst potentially adversely affecting their accuracy. To reduce such complexity, we introduce a new approach for fully automatic generation of higher-order, structured hexahedral meshes of tubular structures, with a focus on healthy blood vessels. The structures are modeled as skeleton-based convolution surfaces. From the same skeleton, the topology is captured by a block-structure, and the geometry by a higher-order surface mesh. Grading may be induced to obtain tailored refinement, thus resolving, e.g., boundary layers. The volumetric meshing is then performed via transfinite mappings. The resulting meshes are of arbitrary order, their elements are of good quality, while the spatial resolution may be as coarse as needed, greatly reducing computing time. Their suitability for practical applications is showcased by a simulation of physiological blood flow modelled by a generalised Newtonian fluid in the human aorta."

"Neural Bokeh: Learning Lens Blur for Computational Videography and Out-of-Focus Mixed Reality.","2024","VR","David Mandl, Shohei Mori, Peter Mohr, Yifan Peng, Tobias Langlotz, Dieter Schmalstieg, Denis Kalkofen","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/vr/MandlMMPLSK24","We present Neural Bokeh, a deep learning approach for synthesizing convincing out-of-focus effects with applications in Mixed Reality (MR) image and video compositing. Unlike existing approaches that solely learn the amount of blur for out-of-focus areas, our approach captures the overall characteristic of the bokeh to enable the seamless integration of rendered scene content into real images, ensuring a consistent lens blur over the resulting MR composition. Our method learns spatially varying blur shapes, i.e., bokeh, from a dataset of real images acquired using the physical camera that is used to capture the photograph or video of the MR composition. Accordingly, those learned blur shapes mimic the characteristics of the physical lens. As the run-time and the resulting quality of Neural Bokeh increase with the resolution of input images, we employ low-resolution images for the MR view finding at runtime and high-resolution renderings for compositing with high-resolution photographs or videos in an offline process. We envision a variety of applications, including visual enhancement of image and video compositing containing creative utilization of out-of-focus effects."
"Progress Observation in Augmented Reality Assembly Tutorials Using Dynamic Hand Gesture Recognition.","2024","VR Workshops","Tania Kairnel, Ana Stanescu 0003, Peter Mohr, Dieter Schmalstieg, Denis Kalkofen","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/vr/Kairnel0MSK24","We propose a proof-of-concept augmented reality assembly tutorial application that uses a video-see-through headset to guide the user through assembly instruction steps. It is solely controlled by observing the user's physical interactions with the workpiece. The tutorial progresses automatically, making use of hand gesture classification to estimate the progression to the next instruction. For dynamic hand gesture classification, we integrate a neural network module to classify the user's hand movement in real time. We evaluate the learned model used in our application to provide insights into the performance of implicit gestural interactions."
"Visual Highlighting for Situated Brushing and Linking.","2024","Comput. Graph. Forum","Nina Doerr, Benjamin Lee, Katarina Baricova, Dieter Schmalstieg, Michael Sedlmair","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/cgf/DoerrLBSS24","Brushing and linking is widely used for visual analytics in desktop environments. However, using this approach to link many data items between situated (e.g., a virtual screen with data) and embedded views (e.g., highlighted objects in the physical environment) is largely unexplored. To this end, we study the effectiveness of visual highlighting techniques in helping users identify and link physical referents to brushed data marks in a situated scatterplot. In an exploratory virtual reality user study (N=20), we evaluated four highlighting techniques under different physical layouts and tasks. We discuss the effectiveness of these techniques, as well as implications for the design of brushing and linking operations in situated analytics."

"Compact World Anchors: Registration Using Parametric Primitives as Scene Description.","2023","IEEE Trans. Vis. Comput. Graph.","Fernando Reyes-Aviles, Philipp Fleck, Dieter Schmalstieg, Clemens Arth","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/tvcg/ReyesAvilesFSA23","We present a registration method relying on geometric constraints extracted from parametric primitives contained in 3D parametric models. Our method solves the registration in closed-form from three line-to-line, line-to-plane or plane-to-plane correspondences. The approach either works with semantically segmented RGB-D scans of the scene or with the output of plane detection in common frameworks like ARKit and ARCore. Based on the primitives detected in the scene, we build a list of descriptors using the normals and centroids of all the found primitives, and match them against the pre-computed list of descriptors from the model in order to find the scene-to-model primitive correspondences. Finally, we use our closed-form solver to estimate the 6DOFtransformation from three lines and one point, which we obtain from the parametric representations of the model and scene parametric primitives. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate the performance and robustness of our method. We show that it can be used to create compact world anchors for indoor localization in AR applications on mobile devices leveraging commercial SLAM capabilities."
"Exemplar-Based Inpainting for 6DOF Virtual Reality Photos.","2023","IEEE Trans. Vis. Comput. Graph.","Shohei Mori, Dieter Schmalstieg, Denis Kalkofen","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/tvcg/MoriSK23a","Multi-layer images are currently the most prominent scene representation for viewing natural scenes under full-motion parallax in virtual reality. Layers ordered in diopter space contain color and transparency so that a complete image is formed when the layers are composited in a view-dependent manner. Once baked, the same limitations apply to multi-layer images as to conventional single-layer photography, making it challenging to remove obstructive objects or otherwise edit the content. Object removal before baking can benefit from filling disoccluded layers with pixels from background layers. However, if no such background pixels have been observed, an inpainting algorithm must fill the empty spots with fitting synthetic content. We present and study a multi-layer inpainting approach that addresses this problem in two stages: First, a volumetric area of interest specified by the user is classified with respect to whether the background pixels have been observed or not. Second, the unobserved pixels are filled with multi-layer inpainting. We report on experiments using multiple variants of multi-layer inpainting and compare our solution to conventional inpainting methods that consider each layer individually."
"Good Keyframes to Inpaint.","2023","IEEE Trans. Vis. Comput. Graph.","Shohei Mori, Dieter Schmalstieg, Denis Kalkofen","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/tvcg/MoriSK23","Diminished Reality (DR) propagates pixels from a keyframe to subsequent frames for real-time inpainting. Keyframe selection has a significant impact on the inpainting quality, but untrained users struggle to identify good keyframes. Automatic selection is not straightforward either, since no previous work has formalized or verified what determines a good keyframe. We propose a novel metric to select good keyframes to inpaint. We examine the heuristics adopted in existing DR inpainting approaches and derive multiple simple criteria measurable from SLAM. To combine these criteria, we empirically analyze their effect on the quality using a novel representative test dataset. Our results demonstrate that the combined metric selects RGBD keyframes leading to high-quality inpainting results more often than a baseline approach in both color and depth domains. Also, we confirmed that our approach has a better ranking ability of distinguishing good and bad keyframes. Compared to random selections, our metric selects keyframes that would lead to higher-quality and more stably converging inpainting results. We present three DR examples, automatic keyframe selection, user navigation, and marker hiding."

Off-axis layered displays combine a head-mounted display with a traditional direct-view display for encoding a focal stack and thus, for providing focus cues. To explore the novel display architecture, we present a complete processing pipeline for the real-time computation and post-render warping of off-axis display patterns. In addition, we build two prototypes using a head-mounted display in combination with a stereoscopic direct-view display, and a more widely available monoscopic direct-view display. In addition we show how extending off-axis layered displays with an attenuation layer and with eye-tracking can improve image quality. We thoroughly analyze each component in a technical evaluation and present examples captured through our prototypes."

"Trim Regions for Online Computation of From-Region Potentially Visible Sets.","2023","ACM Trans. Graph.","Philip Voglreiter, Bernhard Kerbl, Alexander Weinrauch, Joerg H. Mueller, Thomas Neff, Markus Steinberger, Dieter Schmalstieg","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/tog/VoglreiterKWMNSS23","Visibility computation is a key element in computer graphics applications. More specifically, a from-region potentially visible set (PVS) is an established tool in rendering acceleration, but its high computational cost means a from-region PVS is almost always precomputed. Precomputation restricts the use of PVS to static scenes and leads to high storage cost, in particular, if we need fine-grained regions. For dynamic applications, such as streaming content over a variable-bandwidth network, online PVS computation with configurable region size is required. We address this need with trim regions, a new method for generating from-region PVS for arbitrary scenes in real time. Trim regions perform controlled erosion of object silhouettes in image space, implicitly applying the shrinking theorem known from previous work. Our algorithm is the first that applies automatic shrinking to unconstrained 3D scenes, including non-manifold meshes, and does so in real time using an efficient GPU execution model. We demonstrate that our algorithm generates a tight PVS for complex scenes and outperforms previous online methods for from-viewpoint and from-region PVS. It runs at 60 Hz for realistic game scenes consisting of millions of triangles and computes PVS with a tightness matching or surpassing existing approaches."
"Bag of World Anchors for Instant Large-Scale Localization.","2023","IEEE Trans. Vis. Comput. Graph.","Fernando Reyes-Aviles, Philipp Fleck, Dieter Schmalstieg, Clemens Arth","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/tvcg/ReyesAvilesFSA23a","In this work, we present a novel scene description to perform large-scale localization using only geometric constraints. Our work extends compact world anchors with a search data structure to efficiently perform localization and pose estimation of mobile augmented reality devices across multiple platforms (e.g., HoloLens 2, iPad). The algorithm uses a bag-of-words approach to characterize distinct scenes (e.g., rooms). Since the individual scene representations rely on compact geometric (rather than appearance-based) features, the resulting search structure is very lightweight and fast, lending itself to deployment on mobile devices. We present a set of experiments demonstrating the accuracy, performance and scalability of our novel localization method. In addition, we describe several use cases demonstrating how efficient cross-platform localization facilitates sharing of augmented reality experiences."
