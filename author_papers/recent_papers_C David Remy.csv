"Modeling and Experimental Validation of High-Flow Fluid-Driven Membrane Valves for Hyperactuated Soft Robots.","2024","Adv. Intell.

David Remy","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/aisy/DaiVZBBGR24","Herein, the design, modeling, and validation of high‐flow, fluid‐driven, membrane valves tailored specifically for applications in soft robotic systems are described. Targeting the piping problem in hyper‐actuated soft robots, two fluid‐driven membrane valve designs that can admit flows of up to while weighing less than are introduced. A mathematical model to predict fluid flow by representing the displacement of the membrane as a scalar quantity influenced by the balance of pressures applied across the valve's ports is established. The model incorporates six parameters with direct physical relevance, enhancing its usefulness in valve design and system integration. In an experimental validation, flow rates with deviations within 4% are predicted and the onset of flow is correctly identified with an error rate of less than 1%. In addition, applications of these valves for flow amplification and for the creation of a fluid‐driven oscillator are experimentally demonstrated. This research contributes to the advancement of soft robotics by providing a tool for designing, optimizing, and controlling fluid‐driven systems and it lays the groundwork for the future development of embedded, fluid‐controlled valve networks that can be used to realize hyper‐actuated soft robotic systems."

"Swing-Up of a Weakly Actuated Double Pendulum via Nonlinear Normal Modes.","2024","ECC","Arne Sachtler, Davide Calzolari, Maximilian Raff, Annika Schmidt, Yannik P. Wotte, Cosimo Della Santina, C. David Remy, Alin Albu-Schäffer","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/eucc/SachtlerCRSWSRA24","We identify the nonlinear normal modes spawning from the stable equilibrium of a double pendulum under gravity, and we establish their connection to homoclinic orbits through the unstable upright position as energy increases. This result is exploited to devise an efficient swing-up strategy for a double pendulum with weak, saturating actuators. Our approach involves stabilizing the system onto periodic orbits associated with the nonlinear modes while gradually injecting energy. Since these modes are autonomous system evolutions, the required control effort for stabilization is minimal. Even with actuator limitations of less than 1% of the maximum gravitational torque, the proposed method accomplishes the swing-up of the double pendulum by allowing sufficient time."

"The ""Fluid Jacobian"": Modeling force-motion relationships in fluid-driven soft robots.","2024","Int. J. Robotics Res.","C. David Remy, Zachary Brei, Daniel Bruder, Jan Remy, Keith W. Buffinton, R. Brent Gillespie","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/ijrr/RemyBBRBG24","In this paper, we introduce the concept of the Fluid Jacobian, which provides a description of the power transmission that operates between the fluid and mechanical domains in soft robotic systems. It can be understood as a generalization of the traditional kinematic Jacobian that relates the joint space torques and velocities to the task space forces and velocities of a robot. In a similar way, the Fluid Jacobian relates fluid pressure to task space forces and fluid flow to task space velocities. In addition, the Fluid Jacobian can also be regarded as a generalization of the piston cross-sectional area in a fluid-driven cylinder that extends to complex geometries and multiple dimensions. In the following, we present a theoretical derivation of this framework, focus on important special cases, and illustrate the meaning and practical applicability of the Fluid Jacobian in four brief examples."

While PM enables instant structural visualization and opens up a host of industrial and artistic applications, it also raises significant challenges in micro-robot control, communication, and actuation that are difficult to support with existing system-on-chip (SoC) designs. This article presents a high-voltage-generation-and-multiplexer (HVGM) chip specially designed for electrostatic actuation of micro-robots for applications such as PM. The HVGM individually controls 12 pairs of <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$+/-$ </tex-math></inline-formula> electrodes using a positive and negative charge pump and mux-structure, consuming only 286 nW power when switching a 10 pF electrode at 155 V/s, and producing a differential voltage of 103 V (29 <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\times $ </tex-math></inline-formula> voltage gain from 3.6 V) in measurement.

Like Datalog, egglog supports efficient incremental execution, cooperating analyses, and lattice-based reasoning. Like EqSat, egglog supports term rewriting, efficient congruence closure, and extraction of optimized terms.
          We identify two recent applications -- a unification-based pointer analysis in Datalog and an EqSat-based floating-point term rewriter -- that have been hampered by features missing from Datalog but found in EqSat or vice-versa. We evaluate our system by reimplementing those projects in egglog. The resulting systems in egglog are faster, simpler, and fix bugs found in the original systems."

"Modeling and Workspace Characterization of Continuously Compliant Robotic Legs.","2023","IROS","Robin Bendfeld, C. David Remy","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/iros/BendfeldR23","This work introduces a new design paradigm for robotic legs. Our concept extends upon classical series elastic actuation and directly integrates the series compliance into the structure of the leg. This integration reduces the mechanical design complexity and can potentially reduce the overall weight of the leg. In this paper, we introduce a prototype leg with a continuously compliant shank and derive and analyze a non-linear beam model that is used to predict its contact forces. The model is validated in two static experiments: one on the isolated shank and one on the full leg. It shows good agreement with measurements. In our validation, we also studied the influence of the model discretization, showing that about 10 nodes are sufficent. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of a force workspace: the range of forces that can be created by controlling the joint angles of the leg. Due to the coupling of nonlinear deformations and nonlinearities in the kinematics, this workspace is non-trivial. In particular, we demonstrate that it is bounded by a force-singularity in which the force/joint-angle relationship cannot be inverted. The results presented in this work can be applied in the development of state-estimators, set-point filters and controllers, and they can inform the future design of suitable geometries of compliant elements."
"State- Based Control for an Actuated Reciprocal Gait Orthosis.","2023","IROS","Simon Eckstein, Bent Leudesdorff, Christophe Maufroy, Urs Schneider, C. David Remy","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/iros/EcksteinLMSR23","Upright locomotion has many health benefits for patients with spinal cord injury. Passive gait orthoses, such as an isocentric reciprocal gait orthosis (IRGO), allow patients to walk by pushing themselves forward with forearm supports. To move the legs, the IRGO physically couples the motion of stance and swing leg through a linkage. Unfortunately, this locomotion is associated with high metabolic effort. To reduce the metabolic demand while maintaining the advantages of simplicity and low weight of an IRGO, we propose the extension of an IRGO with a single actuator directly integrated into the rocking mechanism and investigate the use of a Hybrid Zero Dynamics based controller to support the user. This is a time-invariant feedback controller, in which a stable reciprocal gait is designed by means of numerically optimized virtual constraints. We evaluate the feasibility of this approach in a sagittal plane model of the dynamic system. For a range of walking speeds and step lengths, we are able to show that the chosen approach has the potential to safely support impaired users walking with IRGOs. The obtained gaits were periodic, stable, maintained a minimal ground clearance and could be implemented with a driving torque of 50 Nm."
