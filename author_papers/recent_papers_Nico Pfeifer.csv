"Attentive Variational Information Bottleneck for TCR-peptide interaction prediction.","2023","Bioinform.","Filippo Grazioli, Pierre Machart, Anja Mösch, Kai Li 0012, Leonardo V. Castorina, Nico Pfeifer, Martin Renqiang Min","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/bioinformatics/GrazioliMMLCPM23","Abstract Motivation We present a multi-sequence generalization of Variational Information Bottleneck and call the resulting model Attentive Variational Information Bottleneck (AVIB). Our AVIB model leverages multi-head self-attention to implicitly approximate a posterior distribution over latent encodings conditioned on multiple input sequences. We apply AVIB to a fundamental immuno-oncology problem: predicting the interactions between T-cell receptors (TCRs) and peptides. Results Experimental results on various datasets show that AVIB significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for TCR–peptide interaction prediction. Additionally, we show that the latent posterior distribution learned by AVIB is particularly effective for the unsupervised detection of out-of-distribution amino acid sequences.

"COmic: convolutional kernel networks for interpretable end-to-end learning on (multi-)omics data.","2023","Bioinform.","Jonas C. Ditz, Bernhard Reuter, Nico Pfeifer","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/bioinformatics/DitzRP23","Abstract Motivation The size of available omics datasets is steadily increasing with technological advancement in recent years. While this increase in sample size can be used to improve the performance of relevant prediction tasks in healthcare, models that are optimized for large datasets usually operate as black boxes. In high-stakes scenarios, like healthcare, using a black-box model poses safety and security issues. Without an explanation about molecular factors and phenotypes that affected the prediction, healthcare providers are left with no choice but to blindly trust the models. We propose a new type of artificial neural network, named Convolutional Omics Kernel Network (COmic). By combining convolutional kernel networks with pathway-induced kernels, our method enables robust and interpretable end-to-end learning on omics datasets ranging in size from a few hundred to several hundreds of thousands of samples. Furthermore, COmic can be easily adapted to utilize multiomics data. Results We evaluated the performance capabilities of COmic on six different breast cancer cohorts. Additionally, we trained COmic models on multiomics data using the METABRIC cohort. Our models performed either better or similar to competitors on both tasks. We show how the use of pathway-induced Laplacian kernels opens the black-box nature of neural networks and results in intrinsically interpretable models that eliminate the need for post hoc explanation models.

While datasets and graph Laplacians for the METABRIC cohort can be downloaded from the above mentioned repository, the labels have to be downloaded from cBioPortal at https://www.cbioportal.org/study/clinicalData?id=brca\_metabric.

"Insights to HIV-1 coreceptor usage by estimating HLA adaptation with Bayesian generalized linear mixed models.","2023","PLoS Comput. Biol.","Anna Hake, Anja Germann, Corena de Beer, Alexander Thielen, Martin Däumer, Wolfgang Preiser, Hagen von Briesen, Nico Pfeifer","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/ploscb/HakeGBTDPBP23","The mechanisms triggering the human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) to switch the coreceptor usage from CCR5 to CXCR4 during the course of infection are not entirely understood. While low CD4+ T cell counts are associated with CXCR4 usage, a predominance of CXCR4 usage with still high CD4+ T cell counts remains puzzling. Here, we explore the hypothesis that viral adaptation to the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex, especially to the HLA class II alleles, contributes to the coreceptor switch. To this end, we sequence the viral gag and env protein with corresponding HLA class I and II alleles of a new cohort of 312 treatment-naive, subtype C, chronically-infected HIV-1 patients from South Africa. To estimate HLA adaptation, we develop a novel computational approach using Bayesian generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs). Our model allows to consider the entire HLA repertoire without restricting the model to pre-learned HLA-polymorphisms as well as to correct for phylogenetic relatedness of the viruses within the model itself to account for founder effects. Using our model, we observe that CXCR4-using variants are more adapted than CCR5-using variants (p-value =1.34e-2). Additionally, adapted CCR5-using variants have a significantly lower predicted false positive rate (FPR) by the geno2pheno[coreceptor] tool compared to the non-adapted CCR5-using variants (p-value =2.21e-2), where a low FPR is associated with CXCR4 usage. Consequently, estimating HLA adaptation can be an asset in predicting not only coreceptor usage, but also an approaching coreceptor switch in CCR5-using variants. We propose the usage of Bayesian GLMMs for modeling virus-host adaptation in general. Author summary Viral control is currently our only counter mechanism against HIV-1 with no practicable cure nor a vaccine at hand. In treatment-naive patients, HLA adaptation and coreceptor usage of HIV-1 play a major role in their capability to control the virus. The interplay between both factors, however, has remained unexplored so far. Assessing the degree of viral HLA adaptation is challenging due to the exceptional genetic diversity of both the HLA complex and HIV-1. Therefore, current approaches constrain the adaptation prediction to a set of p-value selected HLA-polymorphism candidates. The selection of these candidates, however, requires extensive external large-scale population-based experiments that are not always available for the population of interest, especially not for newly emerging viruses. In this work, we present a novel computational approach using Bayesian generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) that enables not only to predict the adaptation to the complete HLA profile of a patient, but also to handle phylogenetic-dependencies of the variants within the model directly. Using this light-weight approach for modeling (any) virus-host adaptation, we show that HLA adaptation is associated with coreceptor usage."
"PlasmoFAB: a benchmark to foster machine learning for Plasmodium falciparum protein antigen candidate prediction.","2023","Bioinform.","Jonas C. Ditz, Jacqueline Wistuba-Hamprecht, Timo Maier, Rolf Fendel, Nico Pfeifer, Bernhard Reuter","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/bioinformatics/DitzWMFPR23","Abstract Motivation Machine learning methods can be used to support scientific discovery in healthcare-related research fields. However, these methods can only be reliably used if they can be trained on high-quality and curated datasets. Currently, no such dataset for the exploration of Plasmodium falciparum protein antigen candidates exists. The parasite P.falciparum causes the infectious disease malaria. Thus, identifying potential antigens is of utmost importance for the development of antimalarial drugs and vaccines. Since exploring antigen candidates experimentally is an expensive and time-consuming process, applying machine learning methods to support this process has the potential to accelerate the development of drugs and vaccines, which are needed for fighting and controlling malaria. Results We developed PlasmoFAB, a curated benchmark that can be used to train machine learning methods for the exploration of P.falciparum protein antigen candidates. We combined an extensive literature search with domain expertise to create high-quality labels for P.falciparum specific proteins that distinguish between antigen candidates and intracellular proteins. Additionally, we used our benchmark to compare different well-known prediction models and available protein localization prediction services on the task of identifying protein antigen candidates. We show that available general-purpose services are unable to provide sufficient performance on identifying protein antigen candidates and are outperformed by our models that were trained on this tailored data. Availability and implementation PlasmoFAB is publicly available on Zenodo with DOI 10.5281/zenodo.7433087. Furthermore, all scripts that were used in the creation of PlasmoFAB and the training and evaluation of machine learning models are open source and publicly available on GitHub here: https://github.com/msmdev/PlasmoFAB."
"Predicting functional effects of ion channel variants using new phenotypic machine learning methods.","2023","PLoS Comput. Biol.","Christian Malte Boßelmann, Ulrike B. S. Hedrich, Holger Lerche, Nico Pfeifer","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/ploscb/BosselmannHLP23","Missense variants in genes encoding ion channels are associated with a spectrum of severe diseases. Variant effects on biophysical function correlate with clinical features and can be categorized as gain- or loss-of-function. This information enables a timely diagnosis, facilitates precision therapy, and guides prognosis. Functional characterization presents a bottleneck in translational medicine. Machine learning models may be able to rapidly generate supporting evidence by predicting variant functional effects. Here, we describe a multi-task multi-kernel learning framework capable of harmonizing functional results and structural information with clinical phenotypes. This novel approach extends the human phenotype ontology towards kernel-based supervised machine learning. Our gain- or loss-of-function classifier achieves high performance (mean accuracy 0.853 SD 0.016, mean AU-ROC 0.912 SD 0.025), outperforming both conventional baseline and state-of-the-art methods. Performance is robust across different phenotypic similarity measures and largely insensitive to phenotypic noise or sparsity. Localized multi-kernel learning offered biological insight and interpretability by highlighting channels with implicit genotype-phenotype correlations or latent task similarity for downstream analysis."
