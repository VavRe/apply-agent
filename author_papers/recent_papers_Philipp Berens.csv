"Benchmarking Dependence Measures to Prevent Shortcut Learning in Medical Imaging.","2024","CoRR","Sarah Müller, Louisa Fay, Lisa M. Koch, Sergios Gatidis, Thomas Küstner, Philipp Berens","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2407-18792","Medical imaging cohorts are often confounded by factors such as acquisition devices, hospital sites, patient backgrounds, and many more. As a result, deep learning models tend to learn spurious correlations instead of causally related features, limiting their generalizability to new and unseen data. This problem can be addressed by minimizing dependence measures between intermediate representations of task-related and non-task-related variables. These measures include mutual information, distance correlation, and the performance of adversarial classifiers. Here, we benchmark such dependence measures for the task of preventing shortcut learning. We study a simplified setting using Morpho-MNIST and a medical imaging task with CheXpert chest radiographs. Our results provide insights into how to mitigate confounding factors in medical imaging."
"Benchmarking Retinal Blood Vessel Segmentation Models for Cross-Dataset and Cross-Disease Generalization.","2024","CoRR","Jeremiah Fadugba, Patrick Köhler, Lisa M. Koch, Petru Manescu, Philipp Berens","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2406-14994","Retinal blood vessel segmentation can extract clinically relevant information from fundus images. As manual tracing is cumbersome, algorithms based on Convolution Neural Networks have been developed. Such studies have used small publicly available datasets for training and measuring performance, running the risk of overfitting. Here, we provide a rigorous benchmark for various architectural and training choices commonly used in the literature on the largest dataset published to date. We train and evaluate five published models on the publicly available FIVES fundus image dataset, which exceeds previous ones in size and quality and which contains also images from common ophthalmological conditions (diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma). We compare the performance of different model architectures across different loss functions, levels of image qualitiy and ophthalmological conditions and assess their ability to perform well in the face of disease-induced domain shifts. Given sufficient training data, basic architectures such as U-Net perform just as well as more advanced ones, and transfer across disease-induced domain shifts typically works well for most architectures. However, we find that image quality is a key factor determining segmentation outcomes. When optimizing for segmentation performance, investing into a well curated dataset to train a standard architecture yields better results than tuning a sophisticated architecture on a smaller dataset or one with lower image quality. We distilled the utility of architectural advances in terms of their clinical relevance therefore providing practical guidance for model choices depending on the circumstances of the clinical setting"
"Diffusion Tempering Improves Parameter Estimation with Probabilistic Integrators for Ordinary Differential Equations.","2024","ICML","Jonas Beck, Nathanael Bosch, Michael Deistler, Kyra L. Kadhim, Jakob H. Macke, Philipp Hennig, Philipp Berens","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/icml/BeckBDKMHB24","Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are widely used to describe dynamical systems in science, but identifying parameters that explain experimental measurements is challenging. In particular, although ODEs are differentiable and would allow for gradient-based parameter optimization, the nonlinear dynamics of ODEs often lead to many local minima and extreme sensitivity to initial conditions. We therefore propose diffusion tempering, a novel regularization technique for probabilistic numerical methods which improves convergence of gradient-based parameter optimization in ODEs. By iteratively reducing a noise parameter of the probabilistic integrator, the proposed method converges more reliably to the true parameters. We demonstrate that our method is effective for dynamical systems of different complexity and show that it obtains reliable parameter estimates for a Hodgkin-Huxley model with a practically relevant number of parameters."
"Disentangling representations of retinal images with generative models.","2024","CoRR","Sarah Müller, Lisa M. Koch, Hendrik P. A. Lensch, Philipp Berens","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2402-19186","Retinal fundus images play a crucial role in the early detection of eye diseases. However, the impact of technical factors on these images can pose challenges for reliable AI applications in ophthalmology. For example, large fundus cohorts are often confounded by factors like camera type, bearing the risk of learning shortcuts rather than the causal relationships behind the image generation process. Here, we introduce a population model for retinal fundus images that effectively disentangles patient attributes from camera effects, enabling controllable and highly realistic image generation. To achieve this, we propose a disentanglement loss based on distance correlation. Through qualitative and quantitative analyses, we show that our models encode desired information in disentangled subspaces and enable controllable image generation based on the learned subspaces, demonstrating the effectiveness of our disentanglement loss.

"Distribution shift detection for the postmarket surveillance of medical AI algorithms: a retrospective simulation study.","2024","npj Digit. Medicine","Lisa M. Koch, Christian F. Baumgartner, Philipp Berens","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/npjdm/KochBB24","AbstractDistribution shifts remain a problem for the safe application of regulated medical AI systems, and may impact their real-world performance if undetected. Postmarket shifts can occur for example if algorithms developed on data from various acquisition settings and a heterogeneous population are predominantly applied in hospitals with lower quality data acquisition or other centre-specific acquisition factors, or where some ethnicities are over-represented. Therefore, distribution shift detection could be important for monitoring AI-based medical products during postmarket surveillance. We implemented and evaluated three deep-learning based shift detection techniques (classifier-based, deep kernel, and multiple univariate kolmogorov-smirnov tests) on simulated shifts in a dataset of 130’486 retinal images. We trained a deep learning classifier for diabetic retinopathy grading. We then simulated population shifts by changing the prevalence of patients’ sex, ethnicity, and co-morbidities, and example acquisition shifts by changes in image quality. We observed classification subgroup performance disparities w.r.t. image quality, patient sex, ethnicity and co-morbidity presence. The sensitivity at detecting referable diabetic retinopathy ranged from 0.50 to 0.79 for different ethnicities. This motivates the need for detecting shifts after deployment. Classifier-based tests performed best overall, with perfect detection rates for quality and co-morbidity subgroup shifts at a sample size of 1000. It was the only method to detect shifts in patient sex, but required large sample sizes ($$&gt; 30^{\prime} 000$$

"Estimating Causal Effects with Double Machine Learning - A Method Evaluation.","2024","CoRR","Jonathan Fuhr, Philipp Berens, Dominik Papies","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2403-14385","The estimation of causal effects with observational data continues to be a very active research area. In recent years, researchers have developed new frameworks which use machine learning to relax classical assumptions necessary for the estimation of causal effects. In this paper, we review one of the most prominent methods -""double/debiased machine learning""(DML) - and empirically evaluate it by comparing its performance on simulated data relative to more traditional statistical methods, before applying it to real-world data. Our findings indicate that the application of a suitably flexible machine learning algorithm within DML improves the adjustment for various nonlinear confounding relationships. This advantage enables a departure from traditional functional form assumptions typically necessary in causal effect estimation. However, we demonstrate that the method continues to critically depend on standard assumptions about causal structure and identification. When estimating the effects of air pollution on housing prices in our application, we find that DML estimates are consistently larger than estimates of less flexible methods. From our overall results, we provide actionable recommendations for specific choices researchers must make when applying DML in practice."
"Interpretable-by-Design Deep Survival Analysis for Disease Progression Modeling.","2024","MICCAI","Julius Gervelmeyer, Sarah Müller, Kerol Djoumessi, David Merle, Simon J. Clark, Lisa M. Koch, Philipp Berens","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/miccai/GervelmeyerMDMCKB24","In the elderly, degenerative diseases often develop differently over time for individual patients. For optimal treatment, physicians and patients would like to know how much time is left for them until symptoms reach a certain stage. However, compared to simple disease detection tasks, disease progression modeling has received much less attention. In addition, most existing models are black-box models which provide little insight into the mechanisms driving the prediction. Here, we introduce an interpretable-by-design survival model to predict the progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) from fundus images. Our model not only achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance compared to black-box models but also provides a sparse map of local evidence of AMD progression for individual patients. Our evidence map faithfully reflects the decision-making process of the model in contrast to widely used post-hoc saliency methods. Furthermore, we show that the identified regions mostly align with established clinical AMD progression markers. We believe that our method may help to inform treatment decisions and may lead to better insights into imaging biomarkers indicative of disease progression.

"Linked Care: A Harmonized Workflow for Medication Ordering, Prescription and Dispensing in Mobile Care Settings.","2024","MIE","Philipp Urbauer, Gerda Huber, Timothy Berens, Benedikt Salzbrunn, Matthias Frohner, Stefan Sauermann","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/mie/UrbauerHBSFS24","The growing demand for care amid changing demographics poses significant challenges exacerbated by decreasing healthcare professional availability. In Austria, the Linked Care project aims to address these challenges by developing an intersectoral, harmonized IT-supported workflow for medication ordering, prescription, and dispense in mobile care settings. A human centered design approach, with user-focused interviews and workshops was used to identify requirements and analyze the workflows. Activity diagrams were used represent workflows. The resulting harmonized workflow, developed through iterative collaboration with care organizations, integrates the LC platform into existing care software. To test and demonstrate the harmonized workflow, mockups were created and evaluated for usability, resulting in positive feedback and suggestions for enhancements. Current workflows revealed media breaches and inefficiencies, which the proposed harmonized workflow seeks to address. The paper concludes with implications for future developments, including the subsequent adoption of a HL7 FHIR Implementation Guide for Austria, based on the defined harmonized workflow, to streamline intersectoral communication and improve efficiency in mobile care settings."

In the retina, functional types can be identified by carefully selected stimuli, but this requires expert domain knowledge and biases the procedure towards previously known cell types. In the visual cortex, it is still unknown what functional types exist and how to identify them. Thus, for unbiased identification of the functional cell types in retina and visual cortex, new approaches are needed. Here we propose an optimization-based clustering approach using deep predictive models to obtain functional clusters of neurons using Most Discriminative Stimuli (MDS). Our approach alternates between stimulus optimization with cluster reassignment akin to an expectation-maximization algorithm. The algorithm recovers functional clusters in mouse retina, marmoset retina and macaque visual area V4. This demonstrates that our approach can successfully find discriminative stimuli across species, stages of the visual system and recording techniques. The resulting most discriminative stimuli can be used to assign functional cell types fast and on the fly, without the need to train complex predictive models or show a large natural scene dataset, paving the way for experiments that were previously limited by experimental time. Crucially, MDS are interpretable: they visualize the distinctive stimulus patterns that most unambiguously identify a specific type of neuron."

A core step to make use of modern point-clouds is to have a reliable classification and identify features of importance for a successful classification. However,&amp;#160; the quality of classification is affected by both the classifier and the complexity of the features which describe the classes. To address the limitations of classification performance, we attempt to answer the question: To what extent can a classifier learn the separation into different classes based on the available features in a given training dataset?We compare several measures of class separability to assess the descriptive value of each feature. A ranked list is generated that includes all individual features as well as all possible combinations within specific groups. Selecting high-ranked features based on their descriptive value allows us to summarize datasets without losing essential information about the individual classes. This is an important step in processing existing training data or in setting priorities for future data collection.In our application experiments, we compare geometric and echo-based features of lidar point-clouds to obtain the most useful sets of features for separating ground and vegetation points into their respective classes. Different scenarios of suburban and natural areas are studied to collect various insights for different classification tasks. In addition, we group features based on various attributes such as acquisition or computational cost and evaluate the benefits of these efforts in terms of a possible better classification result."

"This Actually Looks Like that: Proto-BagNets for Local and Global Interpretability-by-Design.","2024","MICCAI","Kerol Djoumessi, Bubacarr Bah, Laura Kühlewein, Philipp Berens, Lisa M. Koch","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/miccai/DjoumessiBKBK24","Interpretability is a key requirement for the use of machine learning models in high-stakes applications, including medical diagnosis.

In this work, we introduce Proto-BagNets, an interpretable-by-design prototype-based model that combines the advantages of bag-of-local feature models and prototype learning to provide meaningful, coherent, and relevant prototypical parts needed for accurate and interpretable image classification tasks. We evaluated the Proto-BagNet for drusen detection on publicly available retinal OCT data.

Today's scientific challenges are characterised by complexity. Interconnected natural, technological, and human systems are influenced by forces acting across time- and spatial-scales, resulting in complex interactions and emergent behaviours. Understanding these phenomena -- and leveraging scientific advances to deliver innovative solutions to improve society's health, wealth, and well-being -- requires new ways of analysing complex systems. The transformative potential of AI stems from its widespread applicability across disciplines, and will only be achieved through integration across research domains. AI for science is a rendezvous point. It brings together expertise from $\mathrm{AI}$ and application domains; combines modelling knowledge with engineering know-how; and relies on collaboration across disciplines and between humans and machines. Alongside technical advances, the next wave of progress in the field will come from building a community of machine learning researchers, domain experts, citizen scientists, and engineers working together to design and deploy effective AI tools. This report summarises the discussions from the seminar and provides a roadmap to suggest how different communities can collaborate to deliver a new wave of progress in AI and its application for scientific discovery."

However, many real-world datasets with low intrinsic dimensionality reside in an ambient space of much higher dimensionality. We show that in this case traditional persistent homology becomes very sensitive to noise and fails to detect the correct topology. The same holds true for existing refinements of persistent homology. As a remedy, we find that spectral distances on the $k$-nearest-neighbor graph of the data, such as diffusion distance and effective resistance, allow to detect the correct topology even in the presence of high-dimensional noise. Moreover, we derive a novel closed-form formula for effective resistance, and describe its relation to diffusion distances. Finally, we apply these methods to high-dimensional single-cell RNA-sequencing data and show that spectral distances allow robust detection of cell cycle loops."

Koch","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/midl/DonteuIKFBBBK23","Interpreting deep learning models typically relies on post-hoc saliency map techniques. However, these techniques often fail to serve as actionable feedback to clinicians, and they do not directly explain the decision mechanism. Here, we propose an inherently interpretable model that combines the feature extraction capabilities of deep neural networks with advantages of sparse linear models in interpretability. Our approach relies on straightforward but effective changes to a deep bag-of-local-features model (BagNet). These modifications lead to fine-grained and sparse class evidence maps which, by design, correctly reflect the model's decision mechanism. Our model is particularly suited for tasks which rely on characterising regions of interests that are very small and distributed over the image. In this paper, we focus on the detection of Diabetic Retinopathy, which is characterised by the progressive presence of small retinal lesions on fundus images. We observed good classification accuracy despite our added sparseness constraint. In addition, our model precisely highlighted retinal lesions relevant for the disease grading task and excluded irrelevant regions from the decision mechanism. The results suggest our sparse BagNet model can be a useful tool for clinicians as it allows efficient inspection of the model predictions and facilitates clinicians' and patients' trust."

Here, we demonstrate that using a diffusion model in combination with an adversarially robust classifier trained on retinal disease classification tasks enables the generation of highly realistic counterfactuals of retinal fundus images and optical coherence tomography (OCT) B-scans. The key to the realism of counterfactuals is that these classifiers encode salient features indicative for each disease class and can steer the diffusion model to depict disease signs or remove disease-related lesions in a realistic way. In a user study, domain experts also found the counterfactuals generated using our method significantly more realistic than counterfactuals generated from a previous method, and even indistinguishable from real images."
