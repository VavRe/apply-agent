"A Harmonic Framework for the Identification of Linear Time-Periodic Systems.","2024","ACC","Flora Vernerey, Pierre Riedinger, Andrea Iannelli, Jamal Daafouz","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/amcc/VernereyRID24","This paper presents a novel approach for the identification of linear time-periodic (LTP) systems in continuous time. This method is based on harmonic modeling and consists in converting any LTP system into an equivalent LTI system with infinite dimension. Leveraging specific harmonic properties, we demonstrate that solving this infinite-dimensional identification problem can be reduced to solving a finite-dimensional linear least-squares problem. The result is an approximation of the original solution with an arbitrarily small error. Our approach offers several significant advantages. The first one is closely tied to the inherent LTI characteristic of the harmonic system, along with the Toeplitz structure exhibited by its elements. The second advantage is related to the regularization property achieved through the integral action when computing the phasors from input and state trajectories. Finally, our method avoids the computation of signals' derivative. This sets our approach apart from existing methods that rely on such computations, which can be a notable drawback, especially in continuous-time settings. We provide numerical simulations that convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, even in scenarios where signals are corrupted by noise."
"A hybrid systems framework for data-based adaptive control of linear time-varying systems.","2024","CoRR","Andrea Iannelli, Romain Postoyan","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2405-14426","We consider the data-driven stabilization of discrete-time linear time-varying systems. The controller is defined as a linear state-feedback law whose gain is adapted to the plant changes through a data-based event-triggering rule. To do so, we monitor the evolution of a data-based Lyapunov function along the solution. When this Lyapunov function does not satisfy a designed desirable condition, an episode is triggered to update the controller gain and the corresponding Lyapunov function using the last collected data. The resulting closed-loop dynamics hence exhibits both physical jumps, due to the system dynamics, and episodic jumps, which naturally leads to a hybrid discrete-time system. We leverage the inherent robustness of the controller and provide general conditions under which various stability notions can be established for the system. Two notable cases where these conditions are satisfied are treated, and numerical results illustrating the relevance of the approach are discussed."
"Learning soft constrained MPC value functions: Efficient MPC design and implementation providing stability and safety guarantees.","2024","L4DC","Nicolas Chatzikiriakos, Kim Peter Wabersich, Felix Berkel, Patricia Pauli, Andrea Iannelli","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/l4dc/ChatzikiriakosW24","Model Predictive Control (MPC) can be applied to safety-critical control problems, providing closed-loop safety and performance guarantees. Implementation of MPC controllers requires solving an optimization problem at every sampling instant, which is challenging to execute on embedded hardware. To address this challenge, we propose a framework that combines a tightened soft constrained MPC formulation with supervised learning to approximate the MPC value function. This combination enables us to obtain a corresponding optimal control law, which can be implemented efficiently on embedded platforms. The framework ensures stability and constraint satisfaction for various nonlinear systems. While the design effort is similar to that of nominal MPC, the proposed formulation provides input-to-state stability (ISS) with respect to the approximation error of the value function. Furthermore, we prove that the value function corresponding to the soft constrained MPC problem is Lipschitz continuous for Lipschitz continuous systems, even if the optimal control law may be discontinuous. This serves two purposes: First, it allows to relate approximation errors to a sufficiently large constraint tightening to obtain constraint satisfaction guarantees. Second, it paves the way for an efficient supervised learning procedure to obtain a continuous value function approximation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method using a nonlinear numerical example."
"On the Regret of Recursive Methods for Discrete-Time Adaptive Control with Matched Uncertainty.","2024","CoRR","Aren Karapetyan, Efe C. Balta, Anastasios Tsiamis, Andrea Iannelli, John Lygeros","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2404-02023","Continuous-time adaptive controllers for systems with a matched uncertainty often comprise an online parameter estimator and a corresponding parameterized controller to cancel the uncertainty. However, such methods are often impossible to implement directly, as they depend on an unobserved estimation error. We consider the equivalent discrete-time setting with a causal information structure, and propose a novel, online proximal point method-based adaptive controller, that under a sufficient excitation (SE) condition is asymptotically stable and achieves finite regret, scaling only with the time required to fulfill the SE. We show the same also for the widely-used recursive least squares with exponential forgetting controller under a stronger persistence of excitation condition."
"Sample Complexity Bounds for Linear System Identification from a Finite Set.","2024","CoRR","Nicolas Chatzikiriakos, Andrea Iannelli","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2409-11141","This paper considers a finite sample perspective on the problem of identifying an LTI system from a finite set of possible systems using trajectory data. To this end, we use the maximum likelihood estimator to identify the true system and provide an upper bound for its sample complexity. Crucially, the derived bound does not rely on a potentially restrictive stability assumption. Additionally, we leverage tools from information theory to provide a lower bound to the sample complexity that holds independently of the used estimator. The derived sample complexity bounds are analyzed analytically and numerically."
"The Role of Identification in Data-driven Policy Iteration: A System Theoretic Study.","2024","CoRR","Bowen Song, Andrea Iannelli","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2401-06721","The goal of this article is to study fundamental mechanisms behind so‐called indirect and direct data‐driven control for unknown systems. Specifically, we consider policy iteration applied to the linear quadratic regulator problem. Two iterative procedures, where data collected from the system are repeatedly used to compute new estimates of the desired optimal controller, are considered. In indirect policy iteration, data are used to obtain an updated model estimate through a recursive identification scheme, which is used in a certainty‐equivalent fashion to perform the classic policy iteration update. By casting the concurrent model identification and control design as a feedback interconnection between two algorithmic systems, we provide a closed‐loop analysis that shows convergence and robustness properties for arbitrary levels of excitation in the data. In direct policy iteration, data are used to approximate the value function and design the associated controller without requiring the intermediate identification step. After proposing an extension to a recently proposed scheme that overcomes potential identifiability issues, we establish under which conditions this procedure is guaranteed to deliver the optimal controller. Based on these analyses we are able to compare the strengths and limitations of the two approaches, highlighting aspects such as the required samples, convergence properties, and excitation requirement. Simulations are also provided to illustrate the results."
"A Data-Driven Approach to System Invertibility and Input Reconstruction.","2023","CDC","Vikas Kumar Mishra, Andrea Iannelli, Naim Bajçinca","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/cdc/MishraIB23","We consider the problems of system invertibility and input reconstruction for linear time-invariant (LTI) systems using only measured data. The two problems are connected in the sense that input reconstruction is possible provided that the system is left invertible. To verify the latter property without model knowledge, we leverage behavioral systems theory and develop two data-driven algorithms: one based on input/state/output data and the other based only on input/output data. We then consider the problem of input reconstruction for both noise-free and noisy data settings. In the case of noisy data, a statistical approach is leveraged to formulate the problem as a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem. The proposed approaches are finally illustrated with numerical examples that show: exact input reconstruction in the noise-free setting; and the better performance of the MLE-based approach compared to the standard least-norm solution."
"A Dual System-Level Parameterization for Identification from Closed-Loop Data.","2023","CDC","Amber Srivastava, Mingzhou Yin, Andrea Iannelli, Roy S. Smith","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/cdc/SrivastavaYIS23","This work presents a dual system-level param-eterization (D-SLP) method for closed-loop identification of linear time-invariant systems. The recent system -level synthesis framework parameterizes all stabilizing controllers via linear constraints on closed-loop response functions, known as system-level parameters. It was demonstrated that several structural, locality, and communication constraints on the controller can be posed as convex constraints on these system-level parameters. In the current work, the identification problem is treated as a dual of the system-level synthesis problem. The plant model is identified from the dual system-level parameters associated to the plant. In comparison to existing closed-loop identification approaches (such as the dual-Youla parameterization), the D-SLP framework neither requires the knowledge of a nominal plant that is stabilized by the known controller, nor depends upon the choice of factorization of the nominal plant and the stabilizing controller. Numerical simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed D-SLP method in terms of identification errors, compared to existing closed-loop identification techniques."

"A quantitative and constructive proof of Willems' Fundamental Lemma and its implications.","2023","ACC","Julian Berberich, Andrea Iannelli, Alberto Padoan, Jeremy Coulson, Florian Dörfler, Frank Allgöwer","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/amcc/BerberichIPCDA23","Willems’ Fundamental Lemma provides a powerful data-driven parametrization of all trajectories of a controllable linear time-invariant system based on one trajectory with persistently exciting (PE) input. In this paper, we present a novel proof of this result which is inspired by the classical adaptive control literature and differs from existing proofs in multiple aspects. The proof involves a quantitative and directional PE notion, allowing to characterize robust PE properties via singular value bounds, as opposed to binary rank- based PE conditions. Further, the proof is constructive, i.e., we derive an explicit PE lower bound for the generated data. As a contribution of independent interest, we generalize existing PE results from the adaptive control literature and reveal a crucial role of the system’s zeros."
"An Explicit Dual Control Approach for Constrained Reference Tracking of Uncertain Linear Systems.","2023","IEEE Trans. Autom. Control.","Anilkumar Parsi, Andrea Iannelli, Roy S. Smith","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/tac/ParsiIS23","A finite horizon optimal tracking problem is considered for linear dynamical systems subject to parametric uncertainties in the state-space matrices and exogenous disturbances. A suboptimal solution is proposed using a model predictive control (MPC) based explicit dual control approach, which enables active uncertainty learning. A novel algorithm for the design of robustly invariant online terminal sets and terminal controllers is presented. Set membership identification is used to update the parameter uncertainty online. A predicted worst-case cost is used in the MPC optimization problem to model the dual effect of the control input. The cost-to-go is estimated using contractivity of the proposed terminal set and the remaining time horizon, so that the optimizer can estimate future benefits of exploration. The proposed dual control algorithm ensures robust constraint satisfaction and recursive feasibility, and navigates the exploration-exploitation tradeoff using a robust performance metric."
"An Online Learning Analysis of Minimax Adaptive Control.","2023","CDC","Venkatraman Renganathan, Andrea Iannelli, Anders Rantzer","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/cdc/RenganathanIR23","We present an online learning analysis of minimax adaptive control for the case where the uncertainty includes a finite set of linear dynamical systems. Precisely, for each system inside the uncertainty set, we define the model-based regret by comparing the state and input trajectories from the minimax adaptive controller against that of an optimal controller in hindsight that knows the true dynamics. We then define the total regret as the worst case model-based regret with respect to all models in the considered uncertainty set. We study how the total regret accumulates over time and its effect on the adaptation mechanism employed by the controller. Moreover, we investigate the effect of the disturbance on the growth of the regret over time and draw connections between robustness of the controller and the associated regret rate."
"Closed-Loop Finite-Time Analysis of Suboptimal Online Control.","2023","CoRR","Aren Karapetyan, Efe C. Balta, Andrea Iannelli, John Lygeros","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2312-05607","Suboptimal methods in optimal control arise due to a limited computational budget, unknown system dynamics, or a short prediction window among other reasons. Although these methods are ubiquitous, their transient performance remains relatively unstudied. We consider the control of discrete-time, nonlinear time-varying dynamical systems and establish sufficient conditions to analyze the finite-time closed-loop performance of such methods in terms of the additional cost incurred due to suboptimality. Finite-time guarantees allow the control design to distribute a limited computational budget over a time horizon and estimate the on-the-go loss in performance due to sub-optimality. We study exponential incremental input-to-state stabilizing policies, and show that for nonlinear systems, under some mild conditions, this property is directly implied by exponential stability without further assumptions on global smoothness. The analysis is showcased on a suboptimal model predictive control use case."
"Maximum Likelihood Estimation in Data-Driven Modeling and Control.","2023","IEEE Trans. Autom. Control.","Mingzhou Yin, Andrea Iannelli, Roy S. Smith","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/tac/YinIS23","Recently, various algorithms for data-driven simulation and control have been proposed based on the Willems’ fundamental lemma. However, when collected data are noisy, these methods lead to ill-conditioned data-driven model structures. In this article, we present a maximum likelihood framework to obtain an optimal data-driven model, the signal matrix model, in the presence of output noise. Data compression and noise-level estimation schemes are also proposed to apply the algorithm efficiently to large datasets and unknown noise-level scenarios. Two approaches in system identification and receding horizon control are developed based on the derived optimal estimator. The first one identifies a finite impulse response model. This approach improves the least-squares estimator with less restrictive assumptions. The second one applies the signal matrix model as the predictor in predictive control. The control performance is shown to be better than existing data-driven predictive control algorithms, especially under high noise levels. Both approaches demonstrate that the derived estimator provides a promising framework to apply data-driven algorithms to noisy data."
"On the Finite-Time Behavior of Suboptimal Linear Model Predictive Control.","2023","CDC","Aren Karapetyan, Efe C. Balta, Andrea Iannelli, John Lygeros","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/cdc/KarapetyanBIL23","Inexact methods for model predictive control (MPC), such as real-time iterative schemes or time-distributed optimization, alleviate the computational burden of exact MPC by providing suboptimal solutions. While the asymptotic stability of such algorithms is well studied, their finite-time performance has not received much attention. In this work, we quantify the performance of suboptimal linear model predictive control in terms of the additional closed-loop cost incurred due to performing only a finite number of optimization iterations. Leveraging this novel analysis framework, we propose a novel suboptimal MPC algorithm with a diminishing horizon length and finite-time closed-loop performance guarantees. This analysis allows the designer to plan a limited computational power budget distribution to achieve a desired performance level. We provide numerical examples to illustrate the algorithm's transient behavior and computational complexity."
"Stochastic Data-Driven Predictive Control: Regularization, Estimation, and Constraint Tightening.","2023","CoRR","Mingzhou Yin, Andrea Iannelli, Roy S. Smith","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2312-02758","Data-driven predictive control methods based on the Willems' fundamental lemma have shown great success in recent years. These approaches use receding horizon predictive control with nonparametric data-driven predictors instead of model-based predictors. This study addresses three problems of applying such algorithms under unbounded stochastic uncertainties: 1) tuning-free regularizer design, 2) initial condition estimation, and 3) reliable constraint satisfaction, by using stochastic prediction error quantification. The regularizer is designed by leveraging the expected output cost. An initial condition estimator is proposed by filtering the measurements with the one-step-ahead stochastic data-driven prediction. A novel constraint-tightening method, using second-order cone constraints, is presented to ensure high-probability chance constraint satisfaction. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed methods lead to satisfactory control performance in terms of both control cost and constraint satisfaction, with significantly improved initial condition estimation."
"Stochastic MPC With Robustness to Bounded Parameteric Uncertainty.","2023","IEEE Trans. Autom. Control.","Elena Arcari, Andrea Iannelli, Andrea Carron, Melanie N. Zeilinger","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/tac/ArcariICZ23","In this article, we present a stochastic model predictive control approach for discrete-time LTI systems subject to bounded parameteric uncertainty and potentially unbounded stochastic additive noise. The proposed scheme makes use of homothetic tubes along the prediction horizon for a robust treatment of parameteric uncertainty. Stochastic noise is handled by tightening constraints using the concept of probabilistic reachable sets (PRS), which are typically constructed offline by exploiting noise distribution information. In order to address the presence of additional parameteric uncertainty, we introduce a strategy for generating “robustified” PRS based only on the first and second moments of the noise sequence. In the case of quadratic cost functions, and under a further independent identically distributed assumption on the noise distribution, we also provide an average asymptotic performance bound for the l2-norm of the closed-loop state. Finally, the proposed approach is demonstrated in both an illustrative example, and for a building temperature control problem."
