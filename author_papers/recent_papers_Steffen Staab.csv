"CNVVE Dataset clean audio samples.","2024","DaRUS","Ramin Hedeshy, Raphael Menges, Steffen Staab","Data and Artifacts","https://dblp.org/rec/data/10/HedeshyMS24b","Non-verbal voice expressions (NVVEs) have been adopted as a means of human-computer interaction in research studies. However, exploring non-verbal voice-based interactions has been constrained by the limited availability of suitable training data and computational methods for classifying such expressions, leading to a focus on simple binary inputs. We address this issue with a new dataset containing 950 audio samples comprising 6 classes of voice expressions. The data were collected from 42 speakers who donated voice recordings. The classifier was trained on the data using features derived from mel-spectrograms. Furthermore, we studied the effectiveness of data augmentation and improved over the baseline model accuracy significantly with a test accuracy of 96.6% in a 5-fold cross-validation. We have made CNVVE publicly accessible in the hope that it will serve as a benchmark for future research."

"Disambiguating Emotional Connotations of Words Using Contextualized Word Representations.","2024","","Akram Sadat Hosseini, Steffen Staab","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/starsem/HosseiniS24","Understanding emotional nuances in written content is crucial for effective communication; however, the context-dependent nature of language poses challenges in precisely discerning emotions in text. This study contributes to the understanding of how the emotional connotations of a word are influenced by the sentence context in which it appears. Leveraging the contextual understanding embedded in contextualized word representations, we conduct an empirical investigation to (i) evaluate the varying abilities of these representations in distinguishing the diverse emotional connotations evoked by the same word across different contexts, (ii) explore potential biases in these representations toward specific emotions of a word, and (iii) assess the capability of these representations in estimating the number of emotional connotations evoked by a word in diverse contexts. Our experiments, utilizing four popular models—BERT, RoBERTa, XLNet, and GPT-2—and drawing on the GoEmotions and SemEval 2018 datasets, demonstrate that these models effectively discern emotional connotations of words. RoBERTa, in particular, shows superior performance and greater resilience against biases. Our further analysis reveals that disambiguating the emotional connotations of words significantly enhances emotion identification at the sentence level."
"Enhancing Online Meeting Experience through Shared Gaze-Attention.","2024","CHI Extended Abstracts","Chandan Kumar 0003, Bhupender Kumar Saini, Steffen Staab","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/chi/0003SS24","Eye contact represents a fundamental element of human social interactions, providing essential non-verbal signals. Traditionally, it has played a crucial role in fostering social bonds during in-person gatherings. However, in the realm of virtual and online meetings, the capacity for meaningful eye contact is often compromised by the limitations of the platforms we use. In response to this challenge, we present an application framework that leverages webcams to detect and share eye gaze attention among participants. Through the framework, we organized 13 group meetings involving a total of 43 participants. The results highlight that the inclusion of gaze attention can enrich interactive experiences and elevate engagement levels in online meetings. Additionally, our evaluation of two levels of gaze sharing schemes indicates that users predominantly favor viewing gaze attention directed toward themselves, as opposed to visualizing detailed attention, which tends to lead to distraction and information overload."

"From Shapes to Shapes: Inferring SHACL Shapes for Results of SPARQL CONSTRUCT Queries.","2024","WWW","Philipp Seifer, Daniel Hernández 0002, Ralf Lämmel, Steffen Staab","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/www/Seifer0LS24","SPARQL CONSTRUCT queries allow for the specification of data processing pipelines that transform given input graphs into new output graphs. It is now common to constrain graphs through SHACL shapes allowing users to understand which data they can expect and which not. However, it becomes challenging to understand what graph data can be expected at the end of a data processing pipeline without knowing the particular input data: Shape constraints on the input graph may affect the output graph, but may no longer apply literally, and new shapes may be imposed by the query template. In this paper, we study the derivation of shape constraints that hold on all possible output graphs of a given SPARQL CONSTRUCT query. We assume that the SPARQL CONSTRUCT query is fixed, e.g., being part of a program, whereas the input graphs adhere to input shape constraints but may otherwise vary over time and, thus, are mostly unknown. We study a fragment of SPARQL CONSTRUCT queries (SCCQ) and a fragment of SHACL (Simple SHACL). We formally define the problem of deriving the most restrictive set of Simple SHACL shapes that constrain the results from evaluating a SCCQ over any input graph restricted by a given set of Simple SHACL shapes. We propose and implement an algorithm that statically analyses input SHACL shapes and CONSTRUCT queries and prove its soundness and complexity."
"Generating SROI- Ontologies via Knowledge Graph Query Embedding Learning.","2024","ECAI","Daniel Hernández 0002, Mojtaba Nayyeri, Bo Xiong, Yuqicheng Zhu, Evgeny Kharlamov, Steffen Staab","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/ecai/0002NXZKS24","Query embedding approaches answer complex logical queries over incomplete knowledge graphs (KGs) by computing and operating on low-dimensional vector representations of entities, relations, and queries. However, current query embedding models heavily rely on excessively parameterized neural networks and cannot explain the knowledge learned from the graph. We propose a novel query embedding method, AConE, which explains the knowledge learned from the graph in the form of $SROI^-$ description logic axioms while being more parameter-efficient than most existing approaches. AConE associates queries to a $SROI^-$ description logic concept. Every $SROI^-$ concept is embedded as a cone in complex vector space, and each $SROI^-$ relation is embedded as a transformation that rotates and scales cones. We show theoretically that AConE can learn $SROI^-$ axioms, and defines an algebra whose operations correspond one to one to $SROI^-$ description logic concept constructs. Our empirical study on multiple query datasets shows that AConE achieves superior results over previous baselines with fewer parameters. Notably on the WN18RR dataset, AConE achieves significant improvement over baseline models. We provide comprehensive analyses showing that the capability to represent axioms positively impacts the results of query answering."
"HGE: Embedding Temporal Knowledge Graphs in a Product Space of Heterogeneous Geometric Subspaces.","2024","AAAI","Jiaxin Pan 0003, Mojtaba Nayyeri, Yinan Li, Steffen Staab","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/aaai/PanNLS24","Temporal knowledge graphs represent temporal facts (s,p,o,?) relating a subject s and an object o via a relation label p at time ?, where ? could be a time point or time interval. Temporal knowledge graphs may exhibit static temporal patterns at distinct points in time and dynamic temporal patterns between different timestamps. In order to learn a rich set of static and dynamic temporal patterns and apply them for inference, several embedding approaches have been suggested in the literature. However, as most of them resort to single underlying embedding spaces, their capability to model all kinds of temporal patterns was severely limited by having to adhere to the geometric property of their one embedding space. We lift this limitation by an embedding approach that maps temporal facts into a product space of several heterogeneous geometric subspaces with distinct geometric properties, i.e.\ Complex, Dual, and Split-complex spaces. In addition, we propose a temporal-geometric attention mechanism to integrate information from different geometric subspaces conveniently according to the captured relational and temporal information. Experimental results on standard temporal benchmark datasets favorably evaluate our approach against state-of-the-art models."

"Leveraging Wikidata for Biomedical Entity Linking in a Low-Resource Setting: A Case Study for German.","2024","ClinicalNLP@NAACL","Faizan E. Mustafa, Corina Dima, Juan G.

"NestE: Modeling Nested Relational Structures for Knowledge Graph Reasoning.","2024","AAAI","Bo Xiong, Mojtaba Nayyeri, Linhao Luo, Zihao Wang, Shirui Pan, Steffen Staab","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/aaai/XiongNLWPS24","Reasoning with knowledge graphs (KGs) has primarily focused on triple-shaped facts. Recent advancements have been explored to enhance the semantics of these facts by incorporating more potent representations, such as hyper-relational facts. However, these approaches are limited to atomic facts, which describe a single piece of information. This paper extends beyond atomic facts and delves into nested facts, represented by quoted triples where subjects and objects are triples themselves (e.g., ((BarackObama, holds_position, President), succeed_by, (DonaldTrump, holds_position, President))). These nested facts enable the expression of complex semantics like situations over time and logical patterns} over entities and relations. In response, we introduce NestE, a novel KG embedding approach that captures the semantics of both atomic and nested factual knowledge. NestE represents each atomic fact as a 1*3 matrix, and each nested relation is modeled as a 3*3 matrix that rotates the 1*3 atomic fact matrix through matrix multiplication. Each element of the matrix is represented as a complex number in the generalized 4D hypercomplex space, including (spherical) quaternions, hyperbolic quaternions, and split-quaternions. Through thorough analysis, we demonstrate the embedding's efficacy in capturing diverse logical patterns over nested facts, surpassing the confines of first-order logic-like expressions. Our experimental results showcase NestE's significant performance gains over current baselines in triple prediction and conditional link prediction. The code and pre-trained models are open available at https://github.com/xiongbo010/NestE."

However, they are ill-suited for query answering in high-stake domains like medicine because they are typically not robust - even the same query can result in different answers when prompted multiple times. In order to improve the robustness of LLM queries, we propose using ranking queries repeatedly and to aggregate the queries using methods from social choice theory. We study ranking queries in diagnostic settings like medical and fault diagnosis and discuss how the Partial Borda Choice function from the literature can be applied to merge multiple query results. We discuss some additional interesting properties in our setting and evaluate the robustness of our approach empirically."

The concept addresses the representation of knowledge especially taking into account uncertainty, how to design queries and means to detect similarities and analogies. Furthermore, the role of research data management with automatized workflows as a supplier for FAIR data is elaborated."

This limitation makes it difficult to distinguish plausible from implausible answers, posing challenges for the application of KGE methods in high-stakes domains like medicine. We address this issue by applying the theory of conformal prediction that allows generating answer sets, which contain the correct answer with probabilistic guarantees. We explain how conformal prediction can be used to generate such answer sets for link prediction tasks. Our empirical evaluation on four benchmark datasets using six representative KGE methods validates that the generated answer sets satisfy the probabilistic guarantees given by the theory of conformal prediction. We also demonstrate that the generated answer sets often have a sensible size and that the size adapts well with respect to the difficulty of the query."

However, their inherent reliance on linear operations in the form of matrix multiplications limits their ability to fully capture inter-token relationships on their own. We propose M\""obiusAttention, a novel approach that integrates M\""obius transformations within the attention mechanism of Transformer-based models. M\""obius transformations are non-linear operations in spaces over complex numbers with the ability to map between various geometries. By incorporating these properties, M\""obiusAttention empowers models to learn more intricate geometric relationships between tokens and capture a wider range of information through complex-valued weight vectors. We build and pre-train a BERT and a RoFormer version enhanced with M\""obiusAttention, which we then finetune on the GLUE benchmark. We evaluate empirically our approach against the baseline BERT and RoFormer models on a range of downstream tasks. Our approach compares favorably against the baseline models, even with smaller number of parameters suggesting the enhanced expressivity of M\""obiusAttention. This research paves the way for exploring the potential of M\""obius transformations in the complex projective space to enhance the expressivity and performance of foundation models."

We hypothesize that LLMs hybrid reasoning abilities can improve autonomous driving by enabling them to analyze detected object and sensor data, understand driving regulations and physical laws, and offer additional context. This addresses complex scenarios, like decisions in low visibility (due to weather conditions), where traditional methods might fall short. We evaluated Large Language Models (LLMs) based on accuracy by comparing their answers with human-generated ground truth inside CARLA. The results showed that when a combination of images (detected objects) and sensor data is fed into the LLM, it can offer precise information for brake and throttle control in autonomous vehicles across various weather conditions.

To address this, we investigate automating the lane model generation and the use of sparse vehicle observations instead of dense sensor measurements. For our approach, a pre-processing step generates polylines by aligning and aggregating observed lane boundaries. Aligned driven traces are used as starting points for predicting lane pairs defined by the left and right boundary points. We propose Lane Model Transformer Network (LMT-Net), an encoder-decoder neural network architecture that performs polyline encoding and predicts lane pairs and their connectivity. A lane graph is formed by using predicted lane pairs as nodes and predicted lane connectivity as edges. We evaluate the performance of LMT-Net on an internal dataset that consists of multiple vehicle observations as well as human annotations as Ground Truth (GT). The evaluation shows promising results and demonstrates superior performance compared to the implemented baseline on both highway and non-highway Operational Design Domain (ODD)."

Our proposed query language extends SPARQL-star, the query language for RDF-star, with a new type of FROM clause to facilitate operating with multiple and sometimes conflicting beliefs. We show that the proposed query language can express four use case queries, including the following features: (i) querying the belief of an individual, (ii) the aggregating of beliefs, (iii) querying who is conflicting with somebody, and (iv) beliefs about beliefs (i.e., nesting of beliefs)."

Álvarez 0002, Salvatore Ruggieri, Steffen Staab","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/aies/MouganCRS23","Past research has demonstrated that the explicit use of protected attributes in machine learning can improve both performance and fairness. Many machine learning algorithms, however, cannot directly process categorical attributes, such as country of birth or ethnicity. Because protected attributes frequently are categorical, they must be encoded as features that can be input to a chosen machine learning algorithm, e.g. support vector machines, gradient boosting decision trees or linear models. Thereby, encoding methods influence how and what the machine learning algorithm will learn, affecting model performance and fairness. This work compares the accuracy and fairness implications of the two most well-known encoding methods: one-hot encoding and target encoding. We distinguish between two types of induced bias that may arise from these encoding methods and may lead to unfair models. The first type, irreducible bias, is due to direct group category discrimination and the second type, reducible bias, is due to the large variance in statistically underrepresented groups. We investigate the interaction between categorical encodings and target encoding regularization methods that reduce unfairness.

We overcome this issue in our novel framework It ˆ o E by modeling relations between nodes by relation-specific, stochastic transitions. Our framework is based on stochastic It ˆ o processes, which operate on low-dimensional manifolds.

In this work, we propose a novel approach, ReLiNet (Recurrent Linear Parameter Varying Network), to ensure safety for multistep prediction of dynamical systems. Our approach simplifies a recurrent neural network to a switched linear system that is constrained to guarantee exponential stability, which acts as a surrogate for safety from a system-theoretic perspective. Furthermore, ReLiNet's computation can be reduced to a single linear model for each time step, resulting in predictions that are explainable by definition, thereby establishing trust from a human-centric perspective. Our quantitative experiments show that ReLiNet achieves prediction accuracy comparable to that of state-of-the-art recurrent neural networks, while achieving more faithful and robust explanations compared to the model-agnostic explanation method of LIME."

A significant amount of important knowledge, however, is represented by hyper-relational facts where each fact is composed of a primal triple and a set of qualifiers comprising a key-value pair that allows for expressing more complicated semantics. Although some recent works have proposed to embed hyper-relational KGs, these methods fail to capture essential inference patterns of hyper-relational facts such as qualifier monotonicity, qualifier implication, and qualifier mutual exclusion, limiting their generalization capability. To unlock this, we present ShrinkE, a geometric hyper-relational KG embedding method aiming to explicitly model these patterns. ShrinkE models the primal triple as a spatial-functional transformation from the head into a relation-specific box. Each qualifier “shrinks” the box to narrow down the possible answer set and, thus, realizes qualifier monotonicity. The spatial relationships between the qualifier boxes allow for modeling core inference patterns of qualifiers such as implication and mutual exclusion. Experimental results demonstrate ShrinkE’s superiority on three benchmarks of hyper-relational KGs."

To address these issues, fairness-aware machine learning jointly optimizes two (or more) metrics aiming at predictive effectiveness and low unfairness. However, the inherent under-representation of minorities in the data makes the disparate treatment of subpopulations less noticeable and difficult to deal with during learning. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial reweighting method to address such \emph{representation bias}. To balance the data distribution between the majority and the minority groups, our approach deemphasizes samples from the majority group. To minimize empirical risk, our method prefers samples from the majority group that are close to the minority group as evaluated by the Wasserstein distance.

However, interoperability issues between software often hinder disciplinary data integration, leading to the late recognition of violated design constraints. Buildings and Habitats object Model (BHoM) is an open-source framework initiated by Buro Happold, and it provides a unified data model for building design and construction information. Semantic Web technologies can link data effectively, and integrating BHoM and Semantic Web can enhance information exchange efficiency in the building industry. To achieve this integration, Buro Happold and the Institute for Computational Design and Construction, Chair for Computing in Architecture (ICD/CA) from the University of Stuttgart, have been working on a joint research project. The work includes research on BHoM and its parallels with Semantic Web Technologies; the translation of the terminological and assertional layer from BHoM to OWL/RDF named bhOWL (and vice-versa) and the integration of bhOWL with design software and graph databases. The graph database integrated with the work receives data from multiple design software disciplines, allowing users to perform cross-database queries. Because both BHoM and bhOWL are prominently dedicated to design, the proposed tool is currently geared towards co-design by designers from various disciplines, such as architects or structural designers. Designers can make better decisions by accessing data from various disciplines. For instance, an acoustic designer might need to know the structural model's ceiling deformation values to determine the best location to place acoustic insulation. Although the tool fulfills the requirements of certain case studies, such as describing building parts and materials, it is still unable to utilise an extensive OWL vocabulary, and the process of reusing existing ontologies is rigid.

To address the challenge of scarce supervision in the biomedical knowledge fusion (BKF) task, researchers have proposed various unsupervised methods. However, these methods heavily rely on ad-hoc lexical and structural matching algorithms, which fail to capture the rich semantics conveyed by biomedical entities and terms. Recently, neural embedding models have proved effective in semantic-rich tasks, but they rely on sufficient labeled data to be adequately trained.

Knowledge graph embeddings map nodes into a vector space to predict new links, scoring them according to geometric criteria. Relations in the graph may follow patterns that can be learned, e.g., some relations might be symmetric and others might be hierarchical. However, the learning capability of different embedding models varies for each pattern and, so far, no single model can learn all patterns equally well. In this paper, we combine the query representations from several models in a unified one to incorporate patterns that are independently captured by each model. Our combination uses attention to select the most suitable model to answer each query. The models are also mapped onto a non-Euclidean manifold, the Poincaré ball, to capture structural patterns, such as hierarchies, besides relational patterns, such as symmetry. We prove that our combination provides a higher expressiveness and inference power than each model on its own. As a result, the combined model can learn relational and structural patterns. We conduct extensive experimental analysis with various link prediction benchmarks showing that the combined model outperforms individual models, including state-of-the-art approaches."

Query embedding approaches this problem by computing the low-dimensional vector representations of entities, relations, and logical queries. KGs exhibit relational patterns such as symmetry and composition and modeling the patterns can further enhance the performance of query embedding models. However, the role of such patterns in answering FOL queries by query embedding models has not been yet studied in the literature. In this paper, we fill in this research gap and empower FOL queries reasoning with pattern inference by introducing an inductive bias that allows for learning relation patterns. To this end, we develop a novel query embedding method, RoConE, that defines query regions as geometric cones and algebraic query operators by rotations in complex space. RoConE combines the advantages of Cone as a well-specified geometric representation for query embedding, and also the rotation operator as a powerful algebraic operation for pattern inference. Our experimental results on several benchmark datasets confirm the advantage of relational patterns for enhancing logical query answering task."

Recent advancements have been explored to enhance the semantics of these facts by incorporating more potent representations, such as hyper-relational facts. However, these approaches are limited to atomic facts, which describe a single piece of information. This paper extends beyond atomic facts and delves into nested facts, represented by quoted triples where subjects and objects are triples themselves (e.g., ((BarackObama, holds_position, President), succeed_by, (DonaldTrump, holds_position, President))). These nested facts enable the expression of complex semantics like situations over time and logical patterns} over entities and relations. In response, we introduce NestE, a novel KG embedding approach that captures the semantics of both atomic and nested factual knowledge. NestE represents each atomic fact as a 1*3 matrix, and each nested relation is modeled as a 3*3 matrix that rotates the 1*3 atomic fact matrix through matrix multiplication. Each element of the matrix is represented as a complex number in the generalized 4D hypercomplex space, including (spherical) quaternions, hyperbolic quaternions, and split-quaternions. Through thorough analysis, we demonstrate the embedding's efficacy in capturing diverse logical patterns over nested facts, surpassing the confines of first-order logic-like expressions. Our experimental results showcase NestE's significant performance gains over current baselines in triple prediction and conditional link prediction.

In order to learn a rich set of static and dynamic temporal patterns and apply them for inference, several embedding approaches have been suggested in the literature. However, as most of them resort to single underlying embedding spaces, their capability to model all kinds of temporal patterns was severely limited by having to adhere to the geometric property of their one embedding space. We lift this limitation by an embedding approach that maps temporal facts into a product space of several heterogeneous geometric subspaces with distinct geometric properties, i.e.\  Complex,  Dual, and  Split-complex spaces.
