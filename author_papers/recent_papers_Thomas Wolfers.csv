This is partially attributed to the opaqueness of deep learning models, causing insufficient understanding of what underlies their decisions. To overcome this, we trained convolutional neural networks on structural brain scans to differentiate dementia patients from healthy controls, and applied layerwise relevance propagation to procure individual-level explanations of the model predictions. Through extensive validations we demonstrate that deviations recognized by the model corroborate existing knowledge of structural brain aberrations in dementia. By employing the explainable dementia classifier in a longitudinal dataset of patients with mild cognitive impairment, we show that the spatially rich explanations complement the model prediction when forecasting transition to dementia and help characterize the biological manifestation of disease in the individual brain. Overall, our work exemplifies the clinical potential of explainable artificial intelligence in precision medicine."
"Learning Cortical Anomaly through Masked Encoding for Unsupervised Heterogeneity Mapping.","2024","ISBI","Hao-Chun Yang, Ole A. Andreassen, Lars Tjelta Westlye, Andre F. Marquand, Christian F. Beckmann, Thomas Wolfers","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/isbi/YangAWMBW24","The detection of heterogeneous mental disorders based on brain readouts remains challenging due to the complexity of symptoms and the absence of reliable biomarkers. This paper introduces CAM (Cortical Anomaly Detection through Masked Image Modeling), a novel self-supervised framework designed for unsupervised detection of complex brain disorders using cortical surface features. We employ this framework for the detection of individuals on the psychotic spectrum and demonstrate its capabilities compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving an AUC of 0.696 for Schizoaffective and 0.769 for Schizophreniform, without the need for any labels. Furthermore, the analysis of atypical cortical regions, including Pars Triangularis and several frontal areas often implicated in schizophrenia, provides further confidence in our approach. Altogether, we demonstrate a scalable approach for anomaly detection of complex brain disorders based on cortical abnormalities. The code will be made available at https://github.com/chadHGY/CAM."
"To which reference class do you belong? Measuring racial fairness of reference classes with normative modeling.","2024","CoRR","Saige Rutherford, Thomas Wolfers, Charlotte J. Fraza, Nathaniel G. Harrnet, Christian F. Beckmann, Henricus G. Ruhe, Andre F. Marquand","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2407-19114","Reference classes in healthcare establish healthy norms, such as pediatric growth charts of height and weight, and are used to chart deviations from these norms which represent potential clinical risk. How the demographics of the reference class influence clinical interpretation of deviations is unknown. Using normative modeling, a method for building reference classes, we evaluate the fairness (racial bias) in reference models of structural brain images that are widely used in psychiatry and neurology. We test whether including race in the model creates fairer models. We predict self-reported race using the deviation scores from three different reference class normative models, to better understand bias in an integrated, multivariate sense. Across all of these tasks, we uncover racial disparities that are not easily addressed with existing data or commonly used modeling techniques. Our work suggests that deviations from the norm could be due to demographic mismatch with the reference class, and assigning clinical meaning to these deviations should be done with caution. Our approach also suggests that acquiring more representative samples is an urgent research priority."
