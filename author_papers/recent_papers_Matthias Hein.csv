Mastodon is a federated open-source microblogging platform that gained a lot of attention in 2023 as an alternative to Twitter (now rebranded as X). However, searching Mastodon is not straightforward due to its federated architecture. This presents an interesting new challenge for federated IR research, and our corpus is meant as a starting point for the new direction of federated microblog search. To ensure privacy, we host the corpus on TIREx, where it can be processed but neither read nor downloaded, with the goal of developing a shared task and a public leaderboard. We also publish our parallelized and polite Mastodon crawler alongside this paper. 1"

In retrospective studies, artificial intelligence (AI) has proven to be helpful for enhancing melanoma detection. However, there are few prospective studies confirming these promising results. Existing studies are limited by low sample sizes, too homogenous datasets, or lack of inclusion of rare melanoma subtypes, preventing a fair and thorough evaluation of AI and its generalizability, a crucial aspect for its application in the clinical setting. Therefore, we assessed 'All Data are Ext' (ADAE), an established open-source ensemble algorithm for detecting melanomas, by comparing its diagnostic accuracy to that of dermatologists on a prospectively collected, external, heterogeneous test set comprising eight distinct hospitals, four different camera setups, rare melanoma subtypes, and special anatomical sites. We advanced the algorithm with real test-time augmentation (R-TTA, i.e. providing real photographs of lesions taken from multiple angles and averaging the predictions), and evaluated its generalization capabilities. Overall, the AI showed higher balanced accuracy than dermatologists (0.798, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.779-0.814 vs. 0.781, 95% CI 0.760-0.802; p<0.001), obtaining a higher sensitivity (0.921, 95% CI 0.900- 0.942 vs. 0.734, 95% CI 0.701-0.770; p<0.001) at the cost of a lower specificity (0.673, 95% CI 0.641-0.702 vs. 0.828, 95% CI 0.804-0.852; p<0.001). As the algorithm exhibited a significant performance advantage on our heterogeneous dataset exclusively comprising melanoma-suspicious lesions, AI may offer the potential to support dermatologists particularly in diagnosing challenging cases."
"Finetuning Foundation Models for Joint Analysis Optimization.","2024","CoRR","Matthias Vigl, Nicole Hartman, Lukas Heinrich","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2401-13536","Abstract
               In this work we demonstrate that significant gains in performance and data efficiency can be achieved in High Energy Physics (HEP) by moving beyond the standard paradigm of sequential optimization or reconstruction and analysis components. We conceptually connect HEP reconstruction and analysis to modern machine learning workflows such as pretraining, finetuning, domain adaptation and high-dimensional embedding spaces and quantify the gains in the example usecase of searches of heavy resonances decaying via an intermediate di-Higgs system to four b-jets. To our knowledge this is the first example of a low-level feature extraction network finetuned for a downstream HEP analysis objective."

Our RAG-based systems (retrieval-augmented generation) use GPT-3.5, GPT-4, or Mixtral to generate an answer from some retrieved context. For the retrieval, we use PubMed’s search API or a local BM25 index of PubMed abstracts and potentially re-rank the initially retrieved abstracts / snippets with different neural bi-encoder and cross-encoder re-rankers. We test five different retrieval-augmented generation schemes with different orders of generation and retrieval stages. The evaluation results for our submitted systems—although partially inconsistent over different test batches— show three general trends. First, combining BM25-based lexical retrieval with neural re-rankers seems to be a good retrieval setup. Second, answers generated from retrieved snippets as context seem more accurate than answers generated from complete abstracts. Third, GPT-4 generates more accurate answers than GPT-3.5, but Mixtral is on par with GPT-4 when employing a generation-then-retrieve-then-generation scheme."

Data platforms are important in fields with limited data availability and strict regulatory and hierarchical structures, such as healthcare and nursing analytics. Hence, we carefully examine three forerunner initiatives in establishing data platforms in the context of nursing care along normative, organizational, and technical dimensions of governance. The cases were selected due to their high level of comparability and to demonstrate three different types of data governance strategies understood as actions to reconcile conflicting interests regarding data and dealing with prevalent data protection law – ranging from strictly processual approaches to the creation of synthetic data. These findings highlight the importance of considering data governance strategies concisely when building data platforms and suggest considerable variety in the configuration of data governance arrangements."

Rothkopf","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/nips/StraubSKR23","Inverse optimal control can be used to characterize behavior in sequential decision-making tasks. Most existing work, however, is limited to fully observable or linear systems, or requires the action signals to be known. Here, we introduce a probabilistic approach to inverse optimal control for partially observable stochastic non-linear systems with unobserved action signals, which unifies previous approaches to inverse optimal control with maximum causal entropy formulations. Using an explicit model of the noise characteristics of the sensory and motor systems of the agent in conjunction with local linearization techniques, we derive an approximate likelihood function for the model parameters, which can be computed within a single forward pass. We present quantitative evaluations on stochastic and partially observable versions of two classic control tasks and two human behavioral tasks. Importantly, we show that our method can disentangle perceptual factors and behavioral costs despite the fact that epistemic and pragmatic actions are intertwined in sequential decision-making under uncertainty, such as in active sensing and active learning. The proposed method has broad applicability, ranging from imitation learning to sensorimotor neuroscience."

In this paper, we examine the selection into the financial industry based on social preferences. We identify the social preferences of business and economics students, and, for more than six years, follow up on their early career choices and their job placement after graduation. Students eager to work in the financial industry behave in a substantially less trustworthy manner and show less willingness to cooperate than those with other career plans. The job market does not alleviate this selection. Those subjects who find their first permanent job in finance behave in significantly less trustworthy manner in a trust game than those working in other industries.

Applied to the 26 runs submitted to the Touché 2022 task on comparative argument retrieval, our stance-aware re-ranking significantly improves the retrieval effectiveness for all runs when perfect oracle-style stance labels are available. With our most effective practical stance detector based on GPT-3.5 (F₁ of 0.49 on four stance classes), our re-ranking still improves the effectiveness for all runs but only six improvements are significant. Artificially “deteriorating” the oracle-style labels, we further find that an F₁ of 0.90 for stance detection is necessary to significantly improve the retrieval effectiveness for the best run via stance-aware re-ranking."

Standardization is achieved when a retrieval approach implements PyTerrier's interfaces and the input and output of an experiment are compatible with ir_datasets and ir_measures. However, none of this is a must for reproducibility and scalability, as TIRA can run any dockerized software locally or remotely in a cloud-native execution environment. Version control and caching ensure efficient (re)execution. TIRA allows for blind evaluation when an experiment runs on a remote server or cloud not under the control of the experimenter. The test data and ground truth are then hidden from public access, and the retrieval software has to process them in a sandbox that prevents data leaks. We currently host an instance of TIREx with 15 corpora (1.9~billion documents) on which 32 shared retrieval tasks are based. Using Docker images of 50~standard retrieval approaches, we automatically evaluated all approaches on all tasks (50 ⋅ 32 = 1,600 runs) in less than a week on a midsize cluster (1,620 cores and 24 GPUs).

"Tutor In-sight: Guiding and Visualizing Students' Attention with Mixed Reality Avatar Presentation Tools.","2023","CHI","Santawat Thanyadit, Matthias Heintz 0001, Effie L.-C. Law","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/chi/Thanyadit0L23","Remote conferencing systems are increasingly used to supplement or even replace in-person teaching. However, prevailing conferencing systems restrict the teacher’s representation to a webcam live-stream, hamper the teacher’s use of body-language, and result in students’ decreased sense of co-presence and participation. While Virtual Reality (VR) systems may increase student engagement, the teacher may not have the time or expertise to conduct the lecture in VR. To address this issue and bridge the requirements between students and teachers, we have developed Tutor In-sight, a Mixed Reality (MR) avatar augmented into the student’s workspace based on four design requirements derived from the existing literature, namely: integrated virtual with physical space, improved teacher’s co-presence through avatar, direct attention with auto-generated body language, and usable workflow for teachers. Two user studies were conducted from the perspectives of students and teachers to determine the advantages of Tutor In-sight in comparison to two existing conferencing systems, Zoom (video-based) and Mozilla Hubs (VR-based). The participants of both studies favoured Tutor In-sight. Among others, this main finding indicates that Tutor In-sight satisfied the needs of both teachers and students. In addition, the participants’ feedback was used to empirically determine the four main teacher requirements and the four main student requirements in order to improve the future design of MR educational tools."

However, increasing evidence shows that particularly in image analysis, metrics are often chosen inadequately in relation to the underlying research problem. This could be attributed to a lack of accessibility of metric-related knowledge: While taking into account the individual strengths, weaknesses, and limitations of validation metrics is a critical prerequisite to making educated choices, the relevant knowledge is currently scattered and poorly accessible to individual researchers. Based on a multi-stage Delphi process conducted by a multidisciplinary expert consortium as well as extensive community feedback, the present work provides the first reliable and comprehensive common point of access to information on pitfalls related to validation metrics in image analysis. Focusing on biomedical image analysis but with the potential of transfer to other fields, the addressed pitfalls generalize across application domains and are categorized according to a newly created, domain-agnostic taxonomy. To facilitate comprehension, illustrations and specific examples accompany each pitfall. As a structured body of information accessible to researchers of all levels of expertise, this work enhances global comprehension of a key topic in image analysis validation."

However, a prime safety concern in state-of-the art object detection is that standard evaluation schemes utilize safety-agnostic metrics to argue sufficient detection performance. Hence, it is imperative to leverage supplementary domain knowledge to accentuate safety-critical misdetections during evaluation tasks. To tackle the underspecification, this paper introduces a novel credibility metric, called c-flow, for pedestrian bounding boxes. To this end, c-flow relies on a complementary optical flow signal from image sequences and enhances the analyses of safety-critical misdetections without requiring additional labels. We implement and evaluate c-flow with a state-of-the-art pedestrian detector on a large AD dataset. Our analysis demonstrates that c-flow allows developers to identify safety-critical misdetections."

We assess this potential and conduct the first in-depth evaluation study of analytical query processing algorithms inside SGXv2. Our study reveals that, unlike SGXv1, state-of-the-art algorithms like radix joins and SIMD-based scans are a good starting point for achieving high-performance query processing inside SGXv2. However, subtle hardware and software differences still influence code execution inside SGX enclaves and cause substantial overheads.

"Bias of Stochastic Gradient Descent or the Architecture: Disentangling the Effects of Overparameterization of Neural Networks.","2024","ICML","Amit Peleg, Matthias Hein 0001","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/icml/Peleg024","Neural networks typically generalize well when fitting the data perfectly, even though they are heavily overparameterized. Many factors have been pointed out as the reason for this phenomenon, including an implicit bias of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and a possible simplicity bias arising from the neural network architecture. The goal of this paper is to disentangle the factors that influence generalization stemming from optimization and architectural choices by studying random and SGD-optimized networks that achieve zero training error. We experimentally show, in the low sample regime, that overparameterization in terms of increasing width is beneficial for generalization, and this benefit is due to the bias of SGD and not due to an architectural bias. In contrast, for increasing depth, overparameterization is detrimental for generalization, but random and SGD-optimized networks behave similarly, so this can be attributed to an architectural bias.

Furthermore, for safety-critical tasks the black-box nature of their decisions is problematic, and explanations or at least methods which make decisions plausible are needed urgently. In this paper, we address these problems by generating images that optimize a classifier-derived objective using a framework for guided image generation. We analyze the decisions of image classifiers by visual counterfactual explanations (VCEs), detection of systematic mistakes by analyzing images where classifiers maximally disagree, and visualization of neurons and spurious features. In this way, we validate existing observations, e.g. the shape bias of adversarially robust models, as well as novel failure modes, e.g. systematic errors of zero-shot CLIP classifiers. Moreover, our VCEs outperform previous work while being more versatile."

However, one of the core motivations behind the use of software models is inherently human-centred. Models aim to enable practitioners to communicate about software designs, make software understandable, or make software easier to write through domain-specific modelling languages. Several recent studies challenge the idea that these aims can always be reached and indicate that human factors play a role in the success of MDE. However, there is an under-representation of research focusing on human factors in modelling. Methods: During a GI-Dagstuhl seminar, topics related to human factors in modelling were discussed by 26 expert participants from research and industry. Results: In breakout groups, five topics were covered in depth, namely modelling human aspects, factors of modeller experience, diversity and inclusion in MDE, collaboration and MDE, and teaching human-aware MDE. Conclusion: We summarise our insights gained during the discussions on the five topics. We formulate research goals, questions, and propositions that support directing future initiatives towards an MDE community that is aware of and supportive of human factors and values."

This study probes deeper into this issue, focusing on the widespread use of these devices for stalking. Following a dual approach, we analyzed user data from a widely used tracking detection app (over 200,000 active installations) and conducted a comprehensive online survey (N=5,253). Our data analysis reveals a significant prevalence of trackers from major brands such as Apple, Tile, and Samsung. The user data also shows that the app sends about 1,400 alarms daily for unwanted tracking. Survey insights reveal that 44.28% of stalking victims had been subjected to location tracking, with cars emerging as the most common hideout for misused trackers, followed by backpacks and purses. These findings underscore the urgency for more robust solutions. Despite ongoing efforts by manufacturers and researchers, the misuse of Bluetooth trackers remains a significant concern. We advocate for developing more effective tracking detection mechanisms integrated into smartphones by default and creating supportive measures for individuals without smartphone access."

We explore the limits and opportunities of using this proprietary network for large-scale distributed sensing. The key idea is to let low-cost sensing devices emit specially crafted BLE advertisements that trick nearby Apple devices into generating location reports that carry arbitrary sensor data, which can then be retrieved from the Apple servers. This paper reports on our ongoing work to reverse engineer the Find My system and to design a protocol for the efficient and reliable collection of data from sensing devices via the Find My network. Preliminary results from real-world experiments demonstrate the feasibility of our approach and a several-fold performance improvement compared with the state of the art."

"Reducing Texture Bias of Deep Neural Networks via Edge Enhancing Diffusion.","2024","ECAI","Edgar Heinert, Matthias Rottmann, Kira Maag, Karsten Kahl","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/ecai/HeinertRMK24","Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image processing tend to focus on localized texture patterns, commonly referred to as texture bias. While most of the previous works in the literature focus on the task of image classification, we go beyond this and study the texture bias of CNNs in semantic segmentation. In this work, we propose to train CNNs on pre-processed images with less texture to reduce the texture bias. Therein, the challenge is to suppress image texture while preserving shape information. To this end, we utilize edge enhancing diffusion (EED), an anisotropic image diffusion method initially introduced for image compression, to create texture reduced duplicates of existing datasets. Extensive numerical studies are performed with both CNNs and vision transformer models trained on original data and EED-processed data from the Cityscapes dataset and the CARLA driving simulator. We observe strong texture-dependence of CNNs and moderate texture-dependence of transformers. Training CNNs on EED-processed images enables the models to become completely ignorant with respect to texture, demonstrating resilience with respect to texture re-introduction to any degree. Additionally we analyze the performance reduction in depth on a level of connected components in the semantic segmentation and study the influence of EED pre-processing on domain generalization as well as adversarial robustness."
"Robust CLIP: Unsupervised Adversarial Fine-Tuning of Vision Embeddings for Robust Large Vision-Language Models.","2024","ICML","Christian Schlarmann, Naman Deep Singh, Francesco Croce, Matthias Hein 0001","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/icml/SchlarmannSC024","Multi-modal foundation models like OpenFlamingo, LLaVA, and GPT-4 are increasingly used for various real-world tasks. Prior work has shown that these models are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks on the vision modality. These attacks can be leveraged to spread fake information or defraud users, and thus pose a significant risk, which makes the robustness of large multi-modal foundation models a pressing problem. The CLIP model, or one of its variants, is used as a frozen vision encoder in many large vision-language models (LVLMs), e.g. LLaVA and OpenFlamingo. We propose an unsupervised adversarial fine-tuning scheme to obtain a robust CLIP vision encoder, which yields robustness on all vision down-stream tasks (LVLMs, zero-shot classification) that rely on CLIP. In particular, we show that stealth-attacks on users of LVLMs by a malicious third party providing manipulated images are no longer possible once one replaces the original CLIP model with our robust one. No retraining or fine-tuning of the down-stream LVLMs is required. The code and robust models are available at https://github.com/chs20/RobustVLM"
"Segment (Almost) Nothing: Prompt-Agnostic Adversarial Attacks on Segmentation Models.","2024","SaTML","Francesco Croce, Matthias Hein 0001","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/satml/Croce024","General purpose segmentation models are able to generate (semantic) segmentation masks from a variety of prompts, including visual (points, boxes, etc.) and textual (object names) ones. In particular, input images are pre-processed by an image encoder to obtain embedding vectors which are later used for mask predictions. Existing adversarial attacks target the end-to-end tasks, i.e. aim at altering the segmentation mask predicted for a specific image-prompt pair. However, this requires running an individual attack for each new prompt for the same image. We propose instead to generate prompt-agnostic adversarial attacks by maximizing the 2-distance, in the latent space, between the embedding of the original and perturbed images. Since the encoding process only depends on the image, distorted image representations will cause perturbations in the segmentation masks for a variety of prompts. We show that even imperceptible ℓ∞-bounded perturbations of radius ϵ = 1/255 are often sufficient to drastically modify the masks predicted with point, box and text prompts by recently proposed foundation models for segmentation. Moreover, we explore the possibility of creating universal, i.e. non image-specific, attacks which can be readily applied to any input without further computational cost."
"Segmentation-Guided MRI Reconstruction for Meaningfully Diverse Reconstructions.","2024","DGM4MICCAI@MICCAI","Jan Nikolas Morshuis, Matthias Hein 0001, Christian F. Baumgartner","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/miccai/MorshuisHB24","Inverse problems, such as accelerated MRI reconstruction, are ill-posed and an infinite amount of possible and plausible solutions exist. This may not only lead to uncertainty in the reconstructed image but also in downstream tasks such as semantic segmentation. This uncertainty, however, is mostly not analyzed in the literature, even though probabilistic reconstruction models are commonly used. These models can be prone to ignore plausible but unlikely solutions like rare pathologies. Building on MRI reconstruction approaches based on diffusion models, we add guidance to the diffusion process during inference, generating two meaningfully diverse reconstructions corresponding to an upper and lower bound segmentation. The reconstruction uncertainty can then be quantified by the difference between these bounds, which we coin the 'uncertainty boundary'. We analyzed the behavior of the upper and lower bound segmentations for a wide range of acceleration factors and found the uncertainty boundary to be both more reliable and more accurate compared to repeated sampling.

They can be very effectively assisted by a method to search for and identify potential failures and systematic errors before these detectors are deployed. Systematic errors are characterized by combinations of attributes such as object location, scale, orientation, and color, as well as the composition of their respective backgrounds. To identify them, one must rely on something other than real images from a test set because they do not account for very rare but possible combinations of attributes. To overcome this limitation, we propose a pipeline for generating realistic synthetic scenes with fine-grained control, allowing the creation of complex scenes with multiple objects. Our approach, BEV2EGO, allows for a realistic generation of the complete scene with road-contingent control that maps 2D bird's-eye view (BEV) scene configurations to a first-person view (EGO). In addition, we propose a benchmark for controlled scene generation to select the most appropriate generative outpainting model for BEV2EGO. We further use it to perform a systematic analysis of multiple state-of-the-art object detection models and discover differences between them."

We leverage low-rank adaption (LoRA) and diffusion guidance to generate targeted synthetic data for the detection problem.

Previous works mostly performed uncertainty estimation on pixel-level. In a line of research, a connected-component-wise (segment-wise) perspective was taken, approaching uncertainty estimation on an object-level by performing so-called meta classification and regression to estimate uncertainty and prediction quality, respectively. In those works, each predicted segment is considered individually to estimate its uncertainty or prediction quality. However, the neighboring segments may provide additional hints on whether a given predicted segment is of high quality, which we study in the present work. On the basis of uncertainty indicating metrics on segment-level, we use graph neural networks (GNNs) to model the relationship of a given segment's quality as a function of the given segment's metrics as well as those of its neighboring segments. We compare different GNN architectures and achieve a notable performance improvement."

However, spatial understanding of these processes is essential for students and future cardiologists to properly diagnose and treat congenital heart defects. Following a user centered approach, the most crucial embryological stages were identified and translated into a virtual reality learning environment (VRLE) to enable the understanding of the morphological transitions of these stages through advanced interactions. To address individual learning types, we implemented different features and evaluated the application regarding usability, perceived task load, and sense of presence in a user study. We also assessed spatial awareness and knowledge gain, and finally obtained feedback from domain experts. Overall, students and professionals rated the application positively. To minimize distraction from interactive learning content, such VRLEs should consider features for different learning types, allow for gradual habituation, and at the same time provide enough playful stimuli. Our work previews how VR can be integrated into a cardiac embryology education curriculum."

To resolve this debate, it has been suggested that salient stimuli do attract attention but that they can be suppressed to prevent distraction. Some research supporting this viewpoint has focused on a newly discovered ERP component called the distractor positivity (PD), which is thought to measure an inhibitory attentional process. This collaborative review summarizes previous research relying on this component with a specific emphasis on how the PD has been used to understand the ability to ignore distracting stimuli. In particular, we outline how the PD component has been used to gain theoretical insights about how search strategy and learning can influence distraction. We also review alternative accounts of the cognitive processes indexed by the PD component. Ultimately, we conclude that the PD component is a useful tool for understanding inhibitory processes related to distraction and may prove to be useful in other areas of study related to cognitive control."

"A Modern Look at the Relationship between Sharpness and Generalization.","2023","ICML","Maksym Andriushchenko, Francesco Croce, Maximilian Müller, Matthias Hein 0001, Nicolas Flammarion","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/icml/AndriushchenkoC23","Sharpness of minima is a promising quantity that can correlate with generalization in deep networks and, when optimized during training, can improve generalization. However, standard sharpness is not invariant under reparametrizations of neural networks, and, to fix this, reparametrization-invariant sharpness definitions have been proposed, most prominently adaptive sharpness (Kwon et al., 2021). But does it really capture generalization in modern practical settings? We comprehensively explore this question in a detailed study of various definitions of adaptive sharpness in settings ranging from training from scratch on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 to fine-tuning CLIP on ImageNet and BERT on MNLI. We focus mostly on transformers for which little is known in terms of sharpness despite their widespread usage. Overall, we observe that sharpness does not correlate well with generalization but rather with some training parameters like the learning rate that can be positively or negatively correlated with generalization depending on the setup. Interestingly, in multiple cases, we observe a consistent negative correlation of sharpness with out-of-distribution error implying that sharper minima can generalize better. Finally, we illustrate on a simple model that the right sharpness measure is highly data-dependent, and that we do not understand well this aspect for realistic data distributions.

Diaz, Youngsoo Choi, Matthias Heinkenschloss","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2305-15163","This paper integrates nonlinear-manifold reduced order models (NM-ROMs) with domain decomposition (DD). NM-ROMs approximate the full order model (FOM) state in a nonlinear-manifold by training a shallow, sparse autoencoder using FOM snapshot data. These NM-ROMs can be advantageous over linear-subspace ROMs (LS-ROMs) for problems with slowly decaying Kolmogorov n-width. However, the number of NM-ROM parameters that need to be trained scales with the size of the FOM. Moreover, for""extreme-scale""problems, the storage of high-dimensional FOM snapshots alone can make ROM training expensive. To alleviate the training cost, this paper applies DD to the FOM, computes NM-ROMs on each subdomain, and couples them to obtain a global NM-ROM. This approach has several advantages: Subdomain NM-ROMs can be trained in parallel, involve fewer parameters to be trained than global NM-ROMs, require smaller subdomain FOM dimensional training data, and can be tailored to subdomain-specific features of the FOM. The shallow, sparse architecture of the autoencoder used in each subdomain NM-ROM allows application of hyper-reduction (HR), reducing the complexity caused by nonlinearity and yielding computational speedup of the NM-ROM. This paper provides the first application of NM-ROM (with HR) to a DD problem. In particular, this paper details an algebraic DD reformulation of the FOM, training a NM-ROM with HR for each subdomain, and a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) solver to evaluate the coupled global NM-ROM. Theoretical convergence results for the SQP method and a priori and a posteriori error estimates for the DD NM-ROM with HR are provided. The proposed DD NM-ROM with HR approach is numerically compared to a DD LS-ROM with HR on the 2D steady-state Burgers' equation, showing an order of magnitude improvement in accuracy of the proposed DD NM-ROM over the DD LS-ROM."
"An extension of the approximate component mode synthesis method to the heterogeneous Helmholtz equation.","2023","CoRR","Elena Giammatteo, Alexander Heinlein, Matthias Schlottbom","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2303-06671","In this work we propose and analyze an extension of the approximate component mode synthesis (ACMS) method to the heterogeneous Helmholtz equation. The ACMS method has originally been introduced by Hetmaniuk and Lehoucq as a multiscale method to solve elliptic partial differential equations. The ACMS method uses a domain decomposition to separate the numerical approximation by splitting the variational problem into two independent parts: local Helmholtz problems and a global interface problem. While the former are naturally local and decoupled such that they can be easily solved in parallel, the latter requires the construction of suitable local basis functions relying on local eigenmodes and suitable extensions. We carry out a full error analysis of this approach focusing on the case where the domain decomposition is kept fixed, but the number of eigenfunctions is increased. The theoretical results in this work are supported by numerical experiments verifying algebraic convergence for the method. In certain, practically relevant cases, even exponential convergence for the local Helmholtz problems can be achieved without oversampling."
"Architectural Sweet Spots for Modeling Human Label Variation by the Example of Argument Quality: It's Best to Relate Perspectives!","2023","EMNLP","Philipp Heinisch, Matthias Orlikowski, Julia Romberg, Philipp Cimiano","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/emnlp/HeinischORC23","Many annotation tasks in natural language processing are highly subjective in that there can be different valid and justified perspectives on what is a proper label for a given example. This also applies to the judgment of argument quality, where the assignment of a single ground truth is often questionable. At the same time, there are generally accepted concepts behind argumentation that form a common ground. To best represent the interplay of individual and shared perspectives, we consider a continuum of approaches ranging from models that fully aggregate perspectives into a majority label to""share nothing""-architectures in which each annotator is considered in isolation from all other annotators. In between these extremes, inspired by models used in the field of recommender systems, we investigate the extent to which architectures that include layers to model the relations between different annotators are beneficial for predicting single-annotator labels. By means of two tasks of argument quality classification (argument concreteness and validity/novelty of conclusions), we show that recommender architectures increase the averaged annotator-individual F$_1$-scores up to $43\%$ over a majority label model. Our findings indicate that approaches to subjectivity can benefit from relating individual perspectives."
"Certified Defences Against Adversarial Patch Attacks on Semantic Segmentation.","2023","ICLR","Maksym Yatsura, Kaspar Sakmann, N. Grace Hua, Matthias Hein 0001, Jan Hendrik Metzen","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/iclr/YatsuraSH0M23","Adversarial patch attacks are an emerging security threat for real world deep learning applications. We present Demasked Smoothing, the first approach (up to our knowledge) to certify the robustness of semantic segmentation models against this threat model. Previous work on certifiably defending against patch attacks has mostly focused on image classification task and often required changes in the model architecture and additional training which is undesirable and computationally expensive. In Demasked Smoothing, any segmentation model can be applied without particular training, fine-tuning, or restriction of the architecture. Using different masking strategies, Demasked Smoothing can be applied both for certified detection and certified recovery. In extensive experiments we show that Demasked Smoothing can on average certify 64% of the pixel predictions for a 1% patch in the detection task and 48% against a 0.5% patch for the recovery task on the ADE20K dataset."

Empirical research builds a sound foundation for the validity and comparability of the research. A current overview on the evaluation and replicability of SA research objects could help to discuss our empirical standards as a community. However, no such current overview exists.Objective: We aim at assessing the current state of practice of evaluating SA research objects and replication artifact provision in full technical conference papers from 2017 to 2021.Method: We first create a categorization of papers regarding their evaluation and provision of replication artifacts. In a systematic literature review (SLR) with 153 papers we then investigate how SA research objects are evaluated and how artifacts are made available.Results: We found that technical experiments (28%) and case studies (29%) are the most frequently used evaluation methods over all research objects. Functional suitability (46% of evaluated properties) and performance (29%) are the most evaluated properties. 17 papers (11%) provide replication packages and 97 papers (63%) explicitly state threats to validity. 17% of papers reference guidelines for evaluations and 14% of papers reference guidelines for threats to validity.Conclusions: Our results indicate that the generalizability and repeatability of evaluations could be improved to enhance the maturity of the field; although, there are valid reasons for contributions to not publish their data. We derive from our findings a set of four proposals for improving the state of practice in evaluating software architecture research objects. Researchers can use our results to find recommendations on relevant properties to evaluate and evaluation methods to use and to identify reusable evaluation artifacts to compare their novel ideas with other research. Reviewers can use our results to compare the evaluation and replicability of submissions with the state of the practice."

It is the only certification technique which scales directly to datasets of higher dimension such as ImageNet. However, current techniques are not able to utilize the fact that any adversarial example has to lie in the image space, that is [0 , 1] d ; otherwise, one can trivially detect it. To address this suboptimality, we derive new certification formulae which lead to significant improvements in the certified ℓ 1 -robustness without the need of adapting the classifiers or change of smoothing distributions.

In this work we show that perturbing only the affine normalization parameters (typically comprising 0.1% of the total parameters) in the adversarial step of SAM can outperform perturbing all of the parameters.This finding generalizes to different SAM variants and both ResNet (Batch Normalization) and Vision Transformer (Layer Normalization) architectures. We consider alternative sparse perturbation approaches and find that these do not achieve similar performance enhancement at such extreme sparsity levels, showing that this behaviour is unique to the normalization layers. Although our findings reaffirm the effectiveness of SAM in improving generalization performance, they cast doubt on whether this is solely caused by reduced sharpness."
"On the Adversarial Robustness of Multi-Modal Foundation Models.","2023","ICCV","Christian Schlarmann, Matthias Hein 0001","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/iccvw/Schlarmann023","Multi-modal foundation models combining vision and language models such as Flamingo or GPT-4 have recently gained enormous interest. Alignment of foundation models is used to prevent models from providing toxic or harmful output. While malicious users have successfully tried to jailbreak foundation models, an equally important question is if honest users could be harmed by malicious third-party content. In this paper we show that imperceivable attacks on images $\left({{\varepsilon _\infty } = 1/255}\right)$ in order to change the caption output of a multi-modal foundation model can be used by malicious content providers to harm honest users e.g. by guiding them to malicious websites or broadcast fake information. This indicates that countermeasures to adversarial attacks should be used by any deployed multi-modal foundation model. Note: This paper contains fake information to illustrate the outcome of our attacks. It does not reflect the opinion of the authors."

Given the recent debate about whether transformers are more robust than convnets, we revisit adversarial training on ImageNet comparing ViTs and ConvNeXts. Extensive experiments show that minor changes in architecture, most notably replacing PatchStem with ConvStem, and training scheme have a significant impact on the achieved robustness. These changes not only increase robustness in the seen $\ell_\infty$-threat model, but even more so improve generalization to unseen $\ell_1/\ell_2$-attacks. Our modified ConvNeXt, ConvNeXt + ConvStem, yields the most robust $\ell_\infty$-models across different ranges of model parameters and FLOPs, while our ViT + ConvStem yields the best generalization to unseen threat models."

While UWB promises the ability to perform time-of-flight centimeter-accurate distance measurements between two devices, the accuracy and reliability of the implementation in up-to-date consumer devices have not been evaluated so far. In this paper, we present the first evaluation of UWB smartphones from Apple, Google, and Samsung, focusing on accuracy and reliability in passive keyless entry and smart home automation scenarios. To perform the measurements for our analysis, we build a custom-designed testbed based on a Gimbal-based platform for Wireless Evaluation (GWEn), which allows us to create reproducible measurements. All our results, including all measurement data and a manual to reconstruct a GWEn are published online. We find that the evaluated devices can measure the distance with an error of less than 20cm, but fail in producing reliable measurements in all scenarios. Finally, we give recommendations on how to handle measurement results when implementing a passive keyless entry system."
"Sound Randomized Smoothing in Floating-Point Arithmetic.","2023","ICLR","Václav Vorácek, Matthias Hein 0001","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/iclr/Voracek023","Randomized smoothing is sound when using infinite precision. However, we show that randomized smoothing is no longer sound for limited floating-point precision. We present a simple example where randomized smoothing certifies a radius of $1.26$ around a point, even though there is an adversarial example in the distance $0.8$ and extend this example further to provide false certificates for CIFAR10. We discuss the implicit assumptions of randomized smoothing and show that they do not apply to generic image classification models whose smoothed versions are commonly certified. In order to overcome this problem, we propose a sound approach to randomized smoothing when using floating-point precision with essentially equal speed and matching the certificates of the standard, unsound practice for standard classifiers tested so far. Our only assumption is that we have access to a fair coin."
"Spurious Features Everywhere - Large-Scale Detection of Harmful Spurious Features in ImageNet.","2023","ICCV","Yannic Neuhaus, Maximilian Augustin, Valentyn Boreiko, Matthias Hein 0001","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/iccv/NeuhausAB023","Benchmark performance of deep learning classifiers alone is not a reliable predictor for the performance of a deployed model. In particular, if the image classifier has picked up spurious features in the training data, its predictions can fail in unexpected ways. In this paper, we develop a framework that allows us to systematically identify spurious features in large datasets like ImageNet. It is based on our neural PCA components and their visualization. Previous work on spurious features often operates in toy settings or requires costly pixel-wise annotations. In contrast, we work with ImageNet and validate our results by showing that presence of the harmful spurious feature of a class alone is sufficient to trigger the prediction of that class. We introduce the novel dataset ""Spurious ImageNet"" which allows to measure the reliance of any ImageNet classifier on harmful spurious features. Moreover, we introduce SpuFix as a simple mitigation method to reduce the dependence of any ImageNet classifier on previously identified harmful spurious features without requiring additional labels or retraining of the model.

Therefore, for imaging based specialties such as ophthalmology, it would be beneficial to be able to create counterfactual images, illustrating answers to questions like""If the subject had had diabetic retinopathy, how would the fundus image have looked?"". Here, we demonstrate that using a diffusion model in combination with an adversarially robust classifier trained on retinal disease classification tasks enables the generation of highly realistic counterfactuals of retinal fundus images and optical coherence tomography (OCT) B-scans. The key to the realism of counterfactuals is that these classifiers encode salient features indicative for each disease class and can steer the diffusion model to depict disease signs or remove disease-related lesions in a realistic way. In a user study, domain experts also found the counterfactuals generated using our method significantly more realistic than counterfactuals generated from a previous method, and even indistinguishable from real images."
"Nonlinear-manifold reduced order models with domain decomposition.","2023","CoRR","Alejandro N. Diaz, Youngsoo Choi, Matthias Heinkenschloss","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2312-00713","A nonlinear-manifold reduced order model (NM-ROM) is a great way of incorporating underlying physics principles into a neural network-based data-driven approach. We combine NM-ROMs with domain decomposition (DD) for efficient computation. NM-ROMs offer benefits over linear-subspace ROMs (LS-ROMs) but can be costly to train due to parameter scaling with the full-order model (FOM) size. To address this, we employ DD on the FOM, compute subdomain NM-ROMs, and then merge them into a global NM-ROM. This approach has multiple advantages: parallel training of subdomain NM-ROMs, fewer parameters than global NM-ROMs, and adaptability to subdomain-specific FOM features. Each subdomain NM-ROM uses a shallow, sparse autoencoder, enabling hyper-reduction (HR) for improved computational speed. In this paper, we detail an algebraic DD formulation for the FOM, train HR-equipped NM-ROMs for subdomains, and numerically compare them to DD LS-ROMs with HR. Results show a significant accuracy boost, on the order of magnitude, for the proposed DD NM-ROMs over DD LS-ROMs in solving the 2D steady-state Burgers' equation."

We propose several problem-specific novel attacks minimizing different metrics in accuracy and mIoU. The ensemble of our attacks, SEA, shows that existing attacks severely overestimate the robustness of semantic segmentation models. Surprisingly, existing attempts of adversarial training for semantic segmentation models turn out to be weak or even completely non-robust. We investigate why previous adaptations of adversarial training to semantic segmentation failed and show how recently proposed robust ImageNet backbones can be used to obtain adversarially robust semantic segmentation models with up to six times less training time for PASCAL-VOC and the more challenging ADE20k.
