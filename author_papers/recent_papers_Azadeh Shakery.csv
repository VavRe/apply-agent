"Harnessing the Power of Metadata for Enhanced Question Retrieval in Community Question Answering.","2024","IEEE Access","Shima Ghasemi, Azadeh Shakery","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/access/GhasemiS24","Community Question Answering (CQA) forums such as Yahoo! Answers and Stack Overflow have become popular. The main goal of a CQA is to provide the most suitable answer in the shortest possible time. Since there is a reach archive of answered questions, similar question retrieval has received much attention intending to answer questions immediately after asking. One of the main challenges in this task is the lexical gap between questions, which refers to the discrepancies between the terminologies used by users asking questions. In this paper, we use metadata and two transformer-based techniques to improve the translation-based language model as a traditional technique addressing the lexical gap in retrieval systems. To overcome the lexical gap problem, additional context and information about the questions can help. Metadata is a rich source of information that refers to supplementary data associated with each question. Subject, category, and answer are metadata used in this article. To leverage these metadata, two transformer-based methods are employed. First, to utilize category information, we build category-specific dictionaries to obtain more accurate translation probabilities. A BERT model predicts the categories of the questions. Second, to utilize answer information, we propose a question expansion technique. Expansion is done by a transformer-based model using a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) model to generate answers and expand new questions with corresponding answers. Finally, candidate questions are ranked according to their similarity to the expanded new question. Our proposed method achieves 51.47 in terms of MAP, outperforming all state-of-the-art approaches in question retrieval."

"$\Lambda$-DARTS: Mitigating Performance Collapse by Harmonizing Operation Selection among Cells.","2023","ICLR","Sajad Movahedi, Melika Adabinejad, Ayyoob Imani, Arezou Keshavarz, Mostafa Dehghani 0001, Azadeh Shakery, Babak Nadjar Araabi","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/iclr/MovahediAIK0SA23","Differentiable neural architecture search (DARTS) is a popular method for neural architecture search (NAS), which performs cell-search and utilizes continuous relaxation to improve the search efficiency via gradient-based optimization. The main shortcoming of DARTS is performance collapse, where the discovered architecture suffers from a pattern of declining quality during search. Performance collapse has become an important topic of research, with many methods trying to solve the issue through either regularization or fundamental changes to DARTS. However, the weight-sharing framework used for cell-search in DARTS and the convergence of architecture parameters has not been analyzed yet. In this paper, we provide a thorough and novel theoretical and empirical analysis on DARTS and its point of convergence. We show that DARTS suffers from a specific structural flaw due to its weight-sharing framework that limits the convergence of DARTS to saturation points of the softmax function. This point of convergence gives an unfair advantage to layers closer to the output in choosing the optimal architecture, causing performance collapse. We then propose two new regularization terms that aim to prevent performance collapse by harmonizing operation selection via aligning gradients of layers. Experimental results on six different search spaces and three different datasets show that our method ($\Lambda$-DARTS) does indeed prevent performance collapse, providing justification for our theoretical analysis and the proposed remedy."

Verma","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/nle/KarimiSV23","AbstractA new framework for improving event detection is proposed that employs joint information in news media content and social networks, such as Twitter, to leverage detailed coverage of news media and the timeliness of social media. Specifically, a short text clustering method is employed to detect events from tweets, then the language model representations of the detected events are expanded using another set of events obtained from news articles published simultaneously. The expanded representations of events are employed as a new initialization of the clustering method to run another iteration and consequently enhance the event detection results. The proposed framework is evaluated using two datasets: a tweet dataset with event labels and a news dataset containing news articles published during the same time interval as the tweets. Experimental results show that the proposed framework improves the event detection results in terms of F1 measure compared to the results obtained from tweets only."

In this paper we propose a regularization method based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) and adversarial training (AT), that can prevent overﬁtting in neural language models. Unlike common adversarial training methods such as the fast gradient sign method (FGSM) that require a second back-propagation through time, and there-fore effectively require at least twice the amount of time for regular training, the overhead of our method does not exceed more than 20% of the training of the baselines."

To achieve this, data was collected from over sixty professional tournaments held over a period of two years. The players were divided into 5 groups based on the quality of their performance during the studied period. The point values were divided into 7 groups, where the criterion was the difficulty of finishing the leg at a given score. The level of pressure was primarily determined by the opponent’s score situation in a given moment. Data analysis using statistical methods such as tests of proportions and the Cochran-Armitage test did not indicate any statistically significant impacts of pressure on performance among professional players – neither positive nor negative."

"Online news media website ranking using user-generated content.","2021","J. Inf. Sci.","Samaneh Karimi, Azadeh Shakery, Rakesh M. Verma","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/jis/KarimiSV21","News media websites are important online resources that have drawn great attention of text mining researchers. The main aim of this study is to propose a framework for ranking online news websites from different viewpoints. The ranking of news websites provides useful information, which can benefit many news-related tasks such as news retrieval and news recommendation. In the proposed framework, the ranking of news websites is obtained by calculating three measures introduced in the article and based on user-generated content (UGC). Each proposed measure is concerned with the performance of news websites from a particular viewpoint including the completeness of news reports, the diversity of events being covered by the website and its speed. The use of UGC in this framework, as a partly unbiased, real-time and low cost content on the web distinguishes the proposed news website ranking framework from the literature. The results obtained for three prominent news websites, British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), Cable News Network (CNN) and New York Times (NYTimes), show that BBC has the best performance in terms of news completeness and speed, and NYTimes has the best diversity in comparison with the other two websites."

               Wordnet development is an active research area among NLP researchers. Since the manual construction of the English wordnet was very costly both in terms of time and human expertise, automatic approaches have become very popular for wordnet development in languages other than English. Automatic methods usually benefit from an existing wordnet of a high resource language and use it as the backbone of their work. In this article, we present an unsupervised approach for automatic wordnet construction using a combination of Expectation–Maximization and personalized PageRank algorithms. Our method uses some typical and available language resources, so it is applicable to many languages including under-resourced ones. The proposed method needs just a bilingual dictionary and a monolingual corpus for developing a wordnet. In order to evaluate the proposed method, we apply it to the Persian language which is identified as an under-resourced language in NLP tasks. Evaluation results properly indicate the power of the proposed method to construct a high quality and large-scale wordnet for poor-resource languages. According to experiments, we achieve a precision of higher than 93% with a recall of 50%."
