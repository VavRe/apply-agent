"BeeLife: a mobile application to foster environmental awareness in classroom settings.","2023","Frontiers Comput. Sci.","Adrian Stock, Oliver Stock, Julia Mönch, Markus Suren, Nadine Nicole Koch, Günter Daniel Rey, Maria Wirzberger","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/fcomp/StockSMSKRW23","Significant threats to our environment tremendously affect biodiversity and related gains. Particularly wild bees actively contribute by pollinating plants and trees. Their increasing extinction comes with devastating consequences for nutrition and stability of our ecosystem. However, most people lack awareness about those species and their living conditions, preventing them to take on responsibility.We introduce an intervention consisting of a mobile app and related project workshops that foster responsibility already at an early stage in life. Drawing on principles from multimedia learning and child-centered design, six gamified levels and accompanying nature-based activities sensitize for the importance of wild bees and their role for a stable and diverse ecosystem. A pilot evaluation across three schools, involving 44 children aged between 9 and 12, included a pre-, post-, and delayed post-test to inspect app usability and learning gains.Most children perceived the app as intuitive, engaging, and visually appealing, and sustainably benefited from our intervention in terms of retention performance. Teacher interviews following the intervention support the fit with the envisioned target group and the classroom setting.Taken together, the obtained evidence emphasizes the benefits of our intervention, even though our sample size was limited due to dropouts. Future extensions might include adaptive instructional design elements to increase observable learning gains."
"Decoding Mental Effort in a Quasi-Realistic Scenario: A Feasibility Study on Multimodal Data Fusion and Classification.","2023","Sensors","Sabrina Gado, Katharina Lingelbach, Maria Wirzberger, Mathias Vukelic","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/sensors/GadoLWV23","Humans’ performance varies due to the mental resources that are available to successfully pursue a task. To monitor users’ current cognitive resources in naturalistic scenarios, it is essential to not only measure demands induced by the task itself but also consider situational and environmental influences. We conducted a multimodal study with 18 participants (nine female, M = 25.9 with SD = 3.8 years). In this study, we recorded, respiratory, ocular, cardiac, and brain activity using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) while participants performed an adapted version of the warship commander task with concurrent emotional speech distraction. We tested the feasibility of decoding the experienced mental effort with a multimodal machine learning architecture. The architecture comprised feature engineering, model optimisation, and model selection to combine multimodal measurements in a cross-subject classification. Our approach reduces possible overfitting and reliably distinguishes two different levels of mental effort. These findings contribute to the prediction of different states of mental effort and pave the way toward generalised state monitoring across individuals in realistic applications."

"Understanding cognition of laundry habits to foster sustainable behavior.","2023","CogSci","Laura Höpfl, Maria Wirzberger","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/cogsci/HopflW23","AbstractGiven the urgency of climate change action and the significant climate impact of household emissions, understanding the drivers of individuals’ sustainable behavior patterns is more important than ever. Consequently, we investigate whether different clusters of individual users can be distinguished regarding sustainability-related values, attitudes, and intentions. If these diverse clusters exist, we can explore tailored approaches to promote sustainable behavior patterns among them based on their unique needs and targets. For this purpose, we employ a mixed-method approach combining qualitative interviews with a quantitative survey. The obtained insights help us identify core factors that drive sustainable behavior, develop representations of different user groups, and suggest individualized interventions for supporting sustainable behavior patterns. The qualitative part comprised interviews with ten participants, resulting in the development of qualitative personas. Emerging differences could subsequently be used to select validated psychological scales for the quantitative part to confirm the differences. Applying data-driven clustering, we identify five intention-based clusters that vary regarding factors such as belief in climate change, collaboration, or skepticism concerning sustainability. Building on both qualitative and quantitative insights, five validated personas are created for research and practical use. These personas include Socially Sustainable, Responsible Savers, Unconcerned Spenders, Comfort-Oriented, and Skeptical Consumers. Individuals corresponding to the selected persona may, for example, respond positively to sustainability benefits, while others may be more receptive to hedonistic benefits. Addressing related varying motivational factors raises the demand for individualized interventions. These could be achieved by incorporating the personas’ needs with more individualized products and services to promote sustainable behavior."
