"Modeling Capabilities of Digital Twin Platforms - Old Wine in New Bottles?","2024","Modellierung","Jérôme Pfeiffer, Daniel Lehner, Andreas Wortmann 0001, Manuel Wimmer","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/modellierung/PfeifferL0W24","Digital twins are seen as core technologies to tackle the growing complexity of cyber-physical systems to better understand, monitor, and optimize their behavior. Digital twin platforms aim to facilitate the systematic engineering of digital twins by providing dedicated languages and corresponding tools to describe their abilities. However, with the emergence of these languages for digital twins, the question arises what the nature of these languages is and how they differentiate from existing modeling languages already used in the area of cyber-physical systems. To shed more light on this new modeling area, we study in this paper the modeling capabilities of three industrial digital twin platforms and frame them in existing and well-known modeling concepts provided by UML. In particular, we (i) extract the conceptual metamodels of three industrial digital twin platforms, (ii) compare them with common object-oriented modeling concepts of UML, (iii) and provide first insight about the portability of models between the platforms by performing an experiment. In particular, we use UML class diagrams as an anchor for relating the modeling concepts of digital twin platforms and as pivot for digital twin platform portability. Our investigation summarizes current modeling capabilities of digital twin platforms to provide a better understanding of their shared concepts to developers using such platforms. It also shows that these modeling capabilities often rely on well-known modeling concepts, but also add some new aspects. The performed experiment additionally gives first insights into the portability of different digital twin platform metamodels. To sum up, this work can be see as a starting point for uncovering the nature of digital twin modeling and providing a digital twin language family enabling developers to select appropriate modeling features for describing different aspects of digital twins without having to reinventing the wheel."
"Modeling Languages for Automotive Digital Twins: A Survey Among the German Automotive Industry.","2024","MODELS","Jérôme Pfeiffer, Dominik Fuchß, Thomas Kühn 0001, Robin Liebhart, Dirk Neumann 0005, Christer Neimöck, Christian Seiler, Anne Koziolek, Andreas Wortmann 0001","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/models/PfeifferF0L0NSK24","The demand for digital twins and suitable modeling techniques in the automotive industry is increasing rapidly. Yet, there is no common understanding of digital twins in automotive, nor are there modeling techniques established to create automotive digital twins. Recent studies on digital twins focus on the analysis of the literature on digital twins for automotive or in general and, thus, neglect the industrial perspective of automotive practitioners. To mitigate this gap between scientific literature and the industrial perspective, we conducted a questionnaire survey among experts in the German automotive industry to identify i) the desired purposes for and capabilities of digital twins and ii) the modeling techniques related to engineering and operating digital twins across the phases of auto-motive development. To this end, we contacted 189 members of the Software-Defined Car research project and received 96 responses. The results show that digital twins are considered most useful in the usage and support phase of automotive development, representing vehicles as-operated. Moreover, simulation models, source code, and business process models are currently considered the most important models to be integrated into a digital twin alongside the associated, established"

Software language engineering, specifically language composition, is such a complex task requiring expertise in composition mechanisms and language workbenches multi-dimensional language constituents (syntax and semantics). This paper presents an extensible low-code platform with a graphical web-based interface for language composition. It enables composition using language components, facilitating systematic composition within language families promoting reuse and streamlining the management, composition, and derivation of domain-specific languages."

In manufacturing, digital twins can optimize production, prevent failures, and save resources. To consolidate the different approaches to digital twins in manufacturing, ISO 23247 defines the essential functional elements of a digital twin. We present a model-driven digital twin exemplar that realizes part of this standard to analyze milling processes. Our digital twin reference architecture includes a digital twin service component that manages and connects different services to adapt the manufacturing process according to a given objective. Two digital twin services, for the adaptation of component and tool conditions and for geometric error adaptation, illustrate the potential of this reference architecture. The digital twin connects to an industrial milling machine via domain-specific languages. This exemplar uses models at design time and at runtime to separate the concerns of software engineers and domain experts and leverages these models to understand and optimize the use of industrial machine tools."

Chaudron","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/smr/Jolak0LUC23","Designing software is an activity in which software developers think and make design decisions that shape the structure and behavior of software products. Designing software is one of the least understood software engineering activities. In a collaborative design setting, various types of distances can lead to challenges and effects that potentially affect how software is designed. To contribute to a better understanding of collaborative software design, we investigate how communication gaps caused by social and geographic distances affect its design thinking and the creativity of its discussions. To this end, we conducted a multiple‐case study exploring the design thinking and creativity of colocated and distributed software developers in a collaborative design setting. Compared with colocated developers, distributed developers spend less time on exploring the problem space, which could be related to different sociotechnical challenges, such as lack of awareness and common understanding. Distributed development does not seem to affect the creativity of their activities. Developers engaging in collaborative design need to be aware that problem space exploration is reduced in a distributed setting. Unless distributed teams take compensatory measures, this could adversely affect the development. Regarding the effect distance has on creativity, our results are inconclusive and further studies are needed."

DSLs enable non-programming experts to solve problems in their domain, such as modeling production processes, implementing control software, or managing the variability of production systems. A DSL ecosystem encompasses the entire infrastructure (e.g., libraries and tools) built around its language and contributes to the successful and easy adoption thereof by domain experts. We present a maturity evaluation model for DSL ecosystems serving two aims: to developers, it reveals missing but essential aspects of the ecosystem, and users (e.g., industrial companies) can evaluate the maturity of a DSL ecosystem. We propose criteria to evaluate the maturity of DSL ecosystems and apply them to existing, publicly available DSLs which have been adopted in CPPSs. The results demonstrate that all components of the model are covered and they allow for deriving hypotheses about DSL ecosystems used in CPPSs."

Hence, it might be a vital means to reduce the impact of the world-wide scarcity of software-developers. Consequently, many different low-code development platforms (LCDPs) have surfaced in the last 5–10 years, which domain experts must understand to chose the best-possible LCDP for their applications. This choice is not made restricting to front-end features of these LCDPs, but also to back-end features, which the domain experts are usually less familiar with. To support domain experts in making this decision, we have investigated popular LCDPs for features relevant to domain experts. Our findings aim to guide these domain experts, but also researchers in better understanding the landscape of LCDPs."

Yet, the particular integration process and its challenges are poorly understood. The continuous evolution of the robotics sector, incorporating constantly a growing number of technologies, makes the unification of processes increasingly complicated. Nevertheless, current research on robotics software integration largely focuses on specific integration activities instead of considering the overall activity as a process. To provide some insight into the state of robotics software integration, we drove a survey among researchers and practitioners in the field. In this survey, we inquired how robotics software integration is currently performed in order to identify similarities with traditional software development methodologies. Through this study, we discovered commonalities in the phases of the process and potential directions of a future research to address the current challenges in the area."
