"Prompt-based Personality Profiling: Reinforcement Learning for Relevance Filtering.","2024","CoRR","Jan Hofmann, Cornelia Sindermann, Roman Klinger","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2409-04122","Author profiling is the task of inferring characteristics about individuals by analyzing content they share. Supervised machine learning still dominates automatic systems that perform this task, despite the popularity of prompting large language models to address natural language understanding tasks. One reason is that the classification instances consist of large amounts of posts, potentially a whole user profile, which may exceed the input length of Transformers. Even if a model can use a large context window, the entirety of posts makes the application of API-accessed black box systems costly and slow, next to issues which come with such""needle-in-the-haystack""tasks. To mitigate this limitation, we propose a new method for author profiling which aims at distinguishing relevant from irrelevant content first, followed by the actual user profiling only with relevant data. To circumvent the need for relevance-annotated data, we optimize this relevance filter via reinforcement learning with a reward function that utilizes the zero-shot capabilities of large language models. We evaluate our method for Big Five personality trait prediction on two Twitter corpora. On publicly available real-world data with a skewed label distribution, our method shows similar efficacy to using all posts in a user profile, but with a substantially shorter context. An evaluation on a version of these data balanced with artificial posts shows that the filtering to relevant posts leads to a significantly improved accuracy of the predictions."
"The degree of heterogeneity of news consumption in Germany - Descriptive statistics and relations with individual differences in personality, ideological attitudes, and voting intentions.","2024","New Media Soc.","Cornelia Sindermann, Christopher Kannen, Christian Montag","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/nms/SindermannKM24","This study aimed to examine the degree of homogeneity versus heterogeneity of individuals’ political information environments across offline and online media types and relations with sociodemographic variables, personality, and political attitudes. In two online surveys, German participants (sample 1: N = 686; sample 2: N = 702) provided information on sociodemographic variables, consumption of political news, and voting intentions, and completed the Big Five Inventory and Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) and Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) scales. Results revealed that absolutely homogeneous political news consumption was evident for a small proportion of individuals (2.04% and 0.43%). Openness (positively) and Agreeableness (negatively) exhibited significant associations with the degree of heterogeneity of political information environments across samples. No consistent patterns of relations with either the ideological attitudes of RWA and SDO or voting intentions were observed. The findings shed light on the existence of absolutely homogeneous political information environments and “who” might be prone to a more homogeneous versus more heterogeneous information environment."
"Willingness to pay for digital wellbeing features on social network sites: a study with Arab and European samples.","2024","Frontiers Comput. Sci.","Sameha Alshakhsi, Areej Babiker, Cornelia Sindermann, Dena Al-Thani, Christian Montag, Raian Ali","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/fcomp/AlshakhsiBSAMA24","In recent years, concerns over the potential negative impacts of social network sites (SNS) on users’ digital wellbeing are on the rise. These concerns have sparked a growing demand for SNS to introduce changes to their business model and offer features that prioritize users’ wellbeing, even if it means introducing fees to users. Still, it is questionable whether such a new model is welcomed by users and commercially valid. In this paper, we investigate (i) people’s willingness to pay (WTP) for digital wellbeing services designed to foster more autonomy, control, and personal growth in users and (ii) the influence of sociodemographic variables, personality, and social networks use disorder (SNUD) on WTP. Data were collected through an online survey with participants from two distinct cultural contexts, the European and Arabic. The samples comprised 262 participants from Europe (Males: 57.63%) and 251 from Arab countries (Males: 60.56%). The participants ranged in age from 18 to 66 years (MEurope = 29.16, SD = 8.42; MArab = 31.24, SD = 8.23). The results revealed that a notable proportion of participants were willing to pay for digital wellbeing services (Europe: 24%; Arab: 30%). Females in the European sample demonstrated a higher WTP for “Mental Health Issues Minimization” compared to males. In the Arab sample, males showed a higher WTP for “Safeguarding Data Privacy” than females. Multiple regression analyses revealed that SNUD and the need for cognition emerged as significant and positive predictors of WTP in both the European and Arab samples. Differences in the relations of personality traits and sociodemographic variables on WTP in each sample were noted. These insights contribute to our understanding of the factors shaping individuals’ preferences and valuation related to digital wellbeing services on SNS and highlight the importance of considering sociodemographic variables and personal factors as well as cultural contexts when planning and introducing them."
