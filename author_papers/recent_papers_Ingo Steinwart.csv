"Better by Default: Strong Pre-Tuned MLPs and Boosted Trees on Tabular Data.","2024","CoRR","David Holzmüller, Léo Grinsztajn, Ingo Steinwart","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2407-04491","For classification and regression on tabular data, the dominance of gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDTs) has recently been challenged by often much slower deep learning methods with extensive hyperparameter tuning. We address this discrepancy by introducing (a) RealMLP, an improved multilayer perceptron (MLP), and (b) improved default parameters for GBDTs and RealMLP. We tune RealMLP and the default parameters on a meta-train benchmark with 71 classification and 47 regression datasets and compare them to hyperparameter-optimized versions on a disjoint meta-test benchmark with 48 classification and 42 regression datasets, as well as the GBDT-friendly benchmark by Grinsztajn et al. (2022). Our benchmark results show that RealMLP offers a better time-accuracy tradeoff than other neural nets and is competitive with GBDTs. Moreover, a combination of RealMLP and GBDTs with improved default parameters can achieve excellent results on medium-sized tabular datasets (1K--500K samples) without hyperparameter tuning."
"Conditioning of Banach Space Valued Gaussian Random Variables: An Approximation Approach Based on Martingales.","2024","CoRR","Ingo Steinwart","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2404-03453","In this paper we investigate the conditional distributions of two Banach space valued, jointly Gaussian random variables. We show that these conditional distributions are again Gaussian and that their means and covariances are determined by a general finite dimensional approximation scheme based upon a martingale approach. In particular, it turns out that the covariance operators occurring in this scheme converge with respect to the nuclear norm and that the conditional probabilities converge weakly. Moreover, we discuss in detail, how our approximation scheme can be implemented in several classes of important Banach spaces such as (reproducing kernel) Hilbert spaces and spaces of continuous functions. As an example, we then apply our general results to the case of Gaussian processes with continuous paths conditioned to partial but infinite observations of their paths. Here we show that conditioning on sufficiently rich, increasing sets of finitely many observations leads to consistent approximations, that is, both the mean and covariance functions converge uniformly and the conditional probabilities converge weakly. Moreover, we discuss how these results improve our understanding of the popular Gaussian processes for machine learning."
"A Framework and Benchmark for Deep Batch Active Learning for Regression.","2023","J. Mach. Learn. Res.","David Holzmüller, Viktor Zaverkin, Johannes Kästner, Ingo Steinwart","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/jmlr/HolzmullerZKS23","The acquisition of labels for supervised learning can be expensive. To improve the sample efficiency of neural network regression, we study active learning methods that adaptively select batches of unlabeled data for labeling. We present a framework for constructing such methods out of (network-dependent) base kernels, kernel transformations, and selection methods. Our framework encompasses many existing Bayesian methods based on Gaussian process approximations of neural networks as well as non-Bayesian methods. Additionally, we propose to replace the commonly used last-layer features with sketched finite-width neural tangent kernels and to combine them with a novel clustering method. To evaluate different methods, we introduce an open-source benchmark consisting of 15 large tabular regression data sets. Our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art on our benchmark, scales to large data sets, and works out-of-the-box without adjusting the network architecture or training code. We provide open-source code that includes efficient implementations of all kernels, kernel transformations, and selection methods, and can be used for reproducing our results."
"Adaptive Clustering Using Kernel Density Estimators.","2023","J. Mach. Learn. Res.","Ingo Steinwart, Bharath K. Sriperumbudur, Philipp Thomann","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/jmlr/SteinwartST23","We derive and analyze a generic, recursive algorithm for estimating all splits in a finite cluster tree as well as the corresponding clusters. We further investigate statistical properties of this generic clustering algorithm when it receives level set estimates from a kernel density estimator. In particular, we derive finite sample guarantees, consistency, rates of convergence, and an adaptive data-driven strategy for choosing the kernel bandwidth. For these results we do not need continuity assumptions on the density such as H\""{o}lder continuity, but only require intuitive geometric assumptions of non-parametric nature."
"Mind the spikes: Benign overfitting of kernels and neural networks in fixed dimension.","2023","NeurIPS","Moritz Haas, David Holzmüller, Ulrike von Luxburg, Ingo Steinwart","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/nips/HaasHLS23","The success of over-parameterized neural networks trained to near-zero training error has caused great interest in the phenomenon of benign overfitting, where estimators are statistically consistent even though they interpolate noisy training data. While benign overfitting in fixed dimension has been established for some learning methods, current literature suggests that for regression with typical kernel methods and wide neural networks, benign overfitting requires a high-dimensional setting where the dimension grows with the sample size. In this paper, we show that the smoothness of the estimators, and not the dimension, is the key: benign overfitting is possible if and only if the estimator's derivatives are large enough. We generalize existing inconsistency results to non-interpolating models and more kernels to show that benign overfitting with moderate derivatives is impossible in fixed dimension. Conversely, we show that rate-optimal benign overfitting is possible for regression with a sequence of spiky-smooth kernels with large derivatives. Using neural tangent kernels, we translate our results to wide neural networks. We prove that while infinite-width networks do not overfit benignly with the ReLU activation, this can be fixed by adding small high-frequency fluctuations to the activation function. Our experiments verify that such neural networks, while overfitting, can indeed generalize well even on low-dimensional data sets."
