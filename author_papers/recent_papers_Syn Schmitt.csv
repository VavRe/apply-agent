"Automating the Design of Multigrid Methods with Evolutionary Program Synthesis.","2024","","Jonas Schmitt","Books and Theses","https://dblp.org/rec/phd/dnb/Schmitt24","Many of the most fundamental laws of nature can be formulated as partial differential equations (PDEs). Understanding these equations is, therefore, of exceptional importance for many branches of modern science and engineering. However, since the general solution of many PDEs is unknown, the efficient approximate solution of these equations is one of humanity's greatest challenges. While multigrid represents one of the most effective methods for solving PDEs numerically, in many cases, the design of an efficient or at least working multigrid solver is an open problem. This thesis demonstrates that grammar-guided genetic programming, an evolutionary program synthesis technique, can discover multigrid methods of unprecedented structure that achieve a high degree of efficiency and generalization. For this purpose, we develop a novel context-free grammar that enables the automated generation of multigrid methods in a symbolically-manipulable formal language, based on which we can apply the same multigrid-based solver to problems of different sizes without having to adapt its internal structure. Treating the automated design of an efficient multigrid method as a program synthesis task allows us to find novel sequences of multigrid operations, including the combination of different smoothing and coarse-grid correction steps on each level of the discretization hierarchy. To prove the feasibility of this approach, we present its implementation in the form of the Python framework EvoStencils, which is freely available as open-source software. This implementation comprises all steps from representing the algorithmic sequence of a multigrid method in the form of a directed acyclic graph of Python objects to its automatic generation and optimization using the capabilities of the code generation framework ExaStencils and the evolutionary computation library DEAP."
"GazeMotion: Gaze-guided Human Motion Forecasting.","2024","CoRR","Zhiming Hu, Syn Schmitt, Daniel F. B. Haeufle, Andreas Bulling","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2403-09885","We present GazeMotion, a novel method for human motion forecasting that combines information on past human poses with human eye gaze. Inspired by evidence from behavioural sciences showing that human eye and body movements are closely coordinated, GazeMotion first predicts future eye gaze from past gaze, then fuses predicted future gaze and past poses into a gaze-pose graph, and finally uses a residual graph convolutional network to forecast body motion. We extensively evaluate our method on the MoGaze, ADT, and GIMO benchmark datasets and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 7.4% improvement in mean per joint position error. Using head direction as a proxy to gaze, our method still achieves an average improvement of 5.5%. We finally report an online user study showing that our method also outperforms prior methods in terms of perceived realism. These results show the significant information content available in eye gaze for human motion forecasting as well as the effectiveness of our method in exploiting this information."
"Generating Realistic Arm Movements in Reinforcement Learning: A Quantitative Comparison of Reward Terms and Task Requirements.","2024","CoRR","Jhon Charaja, Isabell Wochner, Pierre Schumacher, Winfried Ilg, Martin A. Giese, Christophe Maufroy, Andreas Bulling, Syn Schmitt, Daniel F. B. Haeufle","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2402-13949","Mimicking of human-like arm movement characteristics involves considering three factors during control policy synthesis: (a) task requirements, (b) noise during movement execution, and (c) optimality principles. Previous studies showed that when these factors (a-c) are considered individually, it is possible to synthesize arm movements that either kinematically match experimental data or reproduce the stereotypical triphasic muscle activation pattern. However, no quantitative comparison has assessed the realism of arm movements generated by each factor, nor has it been determined whether combining these factors results in movements with human-like kinematic characteristics and the triphasic muscle pattern. To investigate this, we used reinforcement learning to learn a control policy for a musculoskeletal arm model, aiming to discern which combination of factors (a-c) results in realistic arm movements according to four frequently reported stereotypical characteristics. Our findings indicate that incorporating velocity and acceleration requirements into the reaching task, employing reward terms that minimize mechanical work, hand jerk, and control effort, along with the inclusion of noise during movement, leads to realistic human arm movements by reinforcement learning. We expect that the gained insights will help in the future to better predict desired arm movements and corrective forces in wearable assistive devices."
"HOIMotion: Forecasting Human Motion During Human-Object Interactions Using Egocentric 3D Object Bounding Boxes.","2024","CoRR","Zhiming Hu, Zheming Yin, Daniel F. B. Haeufle, Syn Schmitt, Andreas Bulling","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2407-02633","We present HOIMotion - a novel approach for human motion forecasting during human-object interactions that integrates information about past body poses and egocentric 3D object bounding boxes. Human motion forecasting is important in many augmented reality applications but most existing methods have only used past body poses to predict future motion. HOIMotion first uses an encoder-residual graph convolutional network (GCN) and multi-layer perceptrons to extract features from body poses and egocentric 3D object bounding boxes, respectively. Our method then fuses pose and object features into a novel pose-object graph and uses a residual-decoder GCN to forecast future body motion. We extensively evaluate our method on the Aria digital twin (ADT) and MoGaze datasets and show that HOIMotion consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin of up to 8.7% on ADT and 7.2% on MoGaze in terms of mean per joint position error. Complementing these evaluations, we report a human study (N=20) that shows that the improvements achieved by our method result in forecasted poses being perceived as both more precise and more realistic than those of existing methods. Taken together, these results reveal the significant information content available in egocentric 3D object bounding boxes for human motion forecasting and the effectiveness of our method in exploiting this information."
"NeuroSynt: A Neuro-symbolic Portfolio Solver for Reactive Synthesis.","2024","TACAS","Matthias Cosler, Christopher Hahn, Ayham Omar, Frederik Schmitt","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/tacas/CoslerHOS24","We introduce NeuroSynt, a neuro-symbolic portfolio solver framework for reactive synthesis. At the core of the solver lies a seamless integration of neural and symbolic approaches to solving the reactive synthesis problem. To ensure soundness, the neural engine is coupled with model checkers verifying the predictions of the underlying neural models. The open-source implementation of NeuroSynt provides an integration framework for reactive synthesis in which new neural and state-of-the-art symbolic approaches can be seamlessly integrated. Extensive experiments demonstrate its efficacy in handling challenging specifications, enhancing the state-of-the-art reactive synthesis solvers, with NeuroSynt contributing novel solves in the current SYNTCOMP benchmarks."

Spang, Sebastian Möller 0001, Jan-Niklas Voigt-Antons","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2402-14042","Preservation of private user data is of paramount importance for high Quality of Experience (QoE) and acceptability, particularly with services treating sensitive data, such as IT-based health services. Whereas anonymization techniques were shown to be prone to data re-identification, synthetic data generation has gradually replaced anonymization since it is relatively less time and resource-consuming and more robust to data leakage. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been used for generating synthetic datasets, especially GAN frameworks adhering to the differential privacy phenomena. This research compares state-of-the-art GAN-based models for synthetic data generation to generate time-series synthetic medical records of dementia patients which can be distributed without privacy concerns. Predictive modeling, autocorrelation, and distribution analysis are used to assess the Quality of Generating (QoG) of the generated data. The privacy preservation of the respective models is assessed by applying membership inference attacks to determine potential data leakage risks. Our experiments indicate the superiority of the privacy-preserving GAN (PPGAN) model over other models regarding privacy preservation while maintaining an acceptable level of QoG. The presented results can support better data protection for medical use cases in the future."
"Speech as Interactive Design Material (SIDM): How to design and evaluate task-tailored synthetic voices?","2024","IUI Companion","Mateusz Dubiel, Matthew Peter Aylett, Anuschka Schmitt, Zilin Ma, Gary Hsieh, Thiemo Wambsganss","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/iui/DubielASMHW24","The aim of this workshop is two-fold. First, it aims to establish a research community focused on design and evaluation of synthetic speech (TTS) interfaces that are tailored not only to goal oriented tasks (e.g., food ordering, online shopping) but also personal growth and resilience promoting applications (e.g., coaching, mindful reflection, and tutoring). Second, through discussion and collaborative efforts, to establish a set of practices and standards that will help to improve ecological validity of TTS evaluation. In particular, the workshop will explore the topics such as: interaction design of voice-based conversational interfaces; the interplay between prosodic aspects (e.g., pitch variance, loudness, jitter) of TTS and its impact on voice perception. This workshop will serve as a platform on which to build a community that is better equipped to tackle the dynamic field of interactive TTS interfaces, which remains understudied, yet increasingly pertinent to everyday lives of users."

"GazeMoDiff: Gaze-guided Diffusion Model for Stochastic Human Motion Prediction.","2023","CoRR","Haodong Yan, Zhiming Hu, Syn Schmitt, Andreas Bulling","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2312-12090","Human motion prediction is important for many virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) applications such as collision avoidance and realistic avatar generation. Existing methods have synthesised body motion only from observed past motion, despite the fact that human eye gaze is known to correlate strongly with body movements and is readily available in recent VR/AR headsets. We present GazeMoDiff - a novel gaze-guided denoising diffusion model to generate stochastic human motions. Our method first uses a gaze encoder and a motion encoder to extract the gaze and motion features respectively, then employs a graph attention network to fuse these features, and finally injects the gaze-motion features into a noise prediction network via a cross-attention mechanism to progressively generate multiple reasonable human motions in the future. Extensive experiments on the MoGaze and GIMO datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in terms of multi-modal final displacement error (17.3% on MoGaze and 13.3% on GIMO). We further conducted a human study (N=21) and validated that the motions generated by our method were perceived as both more precise and more realistic than those of prior methods. Taken together, these results reveal the significant information content available in eye gaze for stochastic human motion prediction as well as the effectiveness of our method in exploiting this information."
"Natural and Robust Walking using Reinforcement Learning without Demonstrations in High-Dimensional Musculoskeletal Models.","2023","CoRR","Pierre Schumacher, Thomas Geijtenbeek, Vittorio Caggiano, Vikash Kumar, Syn Schmitt, Georg Martius, Daniel F. B. Haeufle","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2309-02976","Humans excel at robust bipedal walking in complex natural environments. In each step, they adequately tune the interaction of biomechanical muscle dynamics and neuronal signals to be robust against uncertainties in ground conditions. However, it is still not fully understood how the nervous system resolves the musculoskeletal redundancy to solve the multi-objective control problem considering stability, robustness, and energy efficiency. In computer simulations, energy minimization has been shown to be a successful optimization target, reproducing natural walking with trajectory optimization or reflex-based control methods. However, these methods focus on particular motions at a time and the resulting controllers are limited when compensating for perturbations. In robotics, reinforcement learning~(RL) methods recently achieved highly stable (and efficient) locomotion on quadruped systems, but the generation of human-like walking with bipedal biomechanical models has required extensive use of expert data sets. This strong reliance on demonstrations often results in brittle policies and limits the application to new behaviors, especially considering the potential variety of movements for high-dimensional musculoskeletal models in 3D. Achieving natural locomotion with RL without sacrificing its incredible robustness might pave the way for a novel approach to studying human walking in complex natural environments.
