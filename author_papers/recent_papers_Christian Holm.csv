"Emergence of Chemotactic Strategies with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning.","2024","CoRR","Samuel Tovey, Christoph Lohrmann, Christian Holm","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2404-01999","
 Reinforcement learning (RL) is a ﬂexible and eﬃcient method for programming micro-robots in complex environments. Here we investigate whether reinforcement learning can provide insights into biological systems when trained to perform chemotaxis. Namely, whether we can learn about how intelligent agents process given information in order to swim towards a target. We run simulations covering a range of agent shapes, sizes, and swim speeds to determine if the physical constraints on biological swimmers, namely Brownian motion, lead to regions where reinforcement learners’ training fails. We ﬁnd that the RL agents can perform chemotaxis as soon as it is physically possible and, in some cases, even before the active swimming overpowers the stochastic environment. We study the eﬃciency of the emergent policy and identify convergence in agent size and swim speeds. Finally, we study the strategy adopted by the reinforcement learning algorithm to explain how the agents perform their tasks. To this end, we identify three emerging dominant strategies and several rare approaches taken. These strategies, whilst producing almost identical trajectories in simulation, are distinct and give insight into the possible mechanisms behind which biological agents explore their environment and respond to changing conditions."

We aimed to investigate the association between EOA, monitored by wireless pulse oximeter, and nonfatal serious adverse events (SAEs) and mortality within 30 days. We included patients in the Capital Region of Copenhagen between 2017 and 2018. Patients were hospitalized due to acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) or after major elective abdominal cancer surgery, and all were treated with oxygen supply. Patients were divided into groups by their exposure to EOA: no exposure, exposure for 1–59 min or exposure over 60 min. The primary outcome was SAEs or mortality within 30 days. We retrieved data from 567 patients for a total of 43,833 h, of whom, 63% were not exposed to EOA, 26% had EOA for 1–59 min and 11% had EOA for ≥60 min. Nonfatal SAEs or mortality within 30 days developed in 24%, 12% and 22%, respectively, and the adjusted odds ratio for this was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.96–1.01) for every 10 min. increase in EOA, without any subgroup effects. In conclusion, we did not observe higher frequencies of nonfatal SAEs or mortality within 30 days in patients exposed to excessive oxygen administration."
"Generating Reservoir State Descriptions with Random Matrices.","2024","CoRR","Samuel Tovey, Christian Holm, Michael Spannowsky","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2404-07278","We demonstrate a novel approach to reservoir computer measurements using random matrices. We do so to motivate how atomic-scale devices might be used for real-world computing applications. Our approach uses random matrices to construct reservoir measurements, introducing a simple, scalable means for producing state descriptions. In our studies, two reservoirs, a five-atom Heisenberg spin chain, and a five-qubit quantum circuit, perform time series prediction and data interpolation. The performance of the measurement technique and current limitations are discussed in detail alongside an exploration of the diversity of measurements yielded by the random matrices. Additionally, we explore the role of the parameters of the reservoirs, adjusting coupling strength and the measurement dimension, yielding insights into how these learning machines might be automatically tuned for different problems. This research highlights using random matrices to measure simple quantum reservoirs for natural learning devices and outlines a path forward for improving their performance and experimental realization."

However, the volume and complexity of these standards has increased over time, thus complicating access to relevant information for vendors and service providers. Use of Generative AI and in particular Large Language Models, may provide faster access to relevant information. In this paper, we evaluate the capability of state-of-art models to be used as Question-Answering assistants for technical standards document reference. Our contribution is threefold. First, we provide a benchmark and measuring method for evaluating performance of Large Language Models. Second, we do data preprocessing and finetuning for one of these models and provide guidelines to increase model performance. Third, we provide a model of our own, TeleRoBERTa, that performs on-par with foundation models but with an order of magnitude less number of parameters. Results show that Large Language Models can be used as a credible reference tool on telecom technical documents, and thus have potential for a number of different applications from troubleshooting and maintenance, to network operations and software product development."
"Zero Shot Molecular Generation via Similarity Kernels.","2024","CoRR","Rokas Elijosius, Fabian Zills, Ilyes Batatia, Sam Walton Norwood, Dávid Péter Kovács, Christian Holm, Gábor Csányi","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2402-08708","Generative modelling aims to accelerate the discovery of novel chemicals by directly proposing structures with desirable properties. Recently, score-based, or diffusion, generative models have significantly outperformed previous approaches. Key to their success is the close relationship between the score and physical force, allowing the use of powerful equivariant neural networks. However, the behaviour of the learnt score is not yet well understood. Here, we analyse the score by training an energy-based diffusion model for molecular generation. We find that during the generation the score resembles a restorative potential initially and a quantum-mechanical force at the end. In between the two endpoints, it exhibits special properties that enable the building of large molecules. Using insights from the trained model, we present Similarity-based Molecular Generation (SiMGen), a new method for zero shot molecular generation. SiMGen combines a time-dependent similarity kernel with descriptors from a pretrained machine learning force field to generate molecules without any further training. Our approach allows full control over the molecular shape through point cloud priors and supports conditional generation. We also release an interactive web tool that allows users to generate structures with SiMGen online (https://zndraw.icp.uni-stuttgart.de)."

Machine learning, large-scale computing resources, and increased industry focus have resulted in rising investments in computer-driven solutions for data management, simulations, and model generation. However, with this growth in computation has come an even larger expansion of data and with it, complexity in data storage, sharing, and tracking. In this work, we introduce ZnTrack, a Python-driven data versioning tool. ZnTrack builds upon established version control systems to provide a user-friendly and easy-to-use interface for tracking parameters in experiments, designing workflows, and storing and sharing data. From this ability to reduce large datasets to a simple Python script emerges the concept of Data as Code, a core component of the work presented here and an undoubtedly important concept as the age of computation continues to evolve. ZnTrack offers an open-source, FAIR data compatible Python package to enable users to harness these concepts of the future."

"Characterizing Polarization in Social Networks using the Signed Relational Latent Distance Model.","2023","AISTATS","Nikolaos Nakis, Abdulkadir Çelikkanat, Louis Boucherie, Christian Djurhuus, Felix Burmester, Daniel Mathias Holmelund, Monika Frolcová, Morten Mørup","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/aistats/NakisCBDBHFM23","Graph representation learning has become a prominent tool for the characterization and understanding of the structure of networks in general and social networks in particular. Typically, these representation learning approaches embed the networks into a low-dimensional space in which the role of each individual can be characterized in terms of their latent position. A major current concern in social networks is the emergence of polarization and filter bubbles promoting a mindset of""us-versus-them""that may be defined by extreme positions believed to ultimately lead to political violence and the erosion of democracy. Such polarized networks are typically characterized in terms of signed links reflecting likes and dislikes. We propose the latent Signed relational Latent dIstance Model (SLIM) utilizing for the first time the Skellam distribution as a likelihood function for signed networks and extend the modeling to the characterization of distinct extreme positions by constraining the embedding space to polytopes. On four real social signed networks of polarization, we demonstrate that the model extracts low-dimensional characterizations that well predict friendships and animosity while providing interpretable visualizations defined by extreme positions when endowing the model with an embedding space restricted to polytopes."

Cheminformatics","Samuel Tovey, Fabian Zills, Francisco Torres-Herrador, Christoph Lohrmann, Marco Brückner, Christian Holm","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/jcheminf/ToveyZTLBH23","AbstractParticle-Based (PB) simulations, including Molecular Dynamics (MD), provide access to system observables that are not easily available experimentally. However, in most cases, PB data needs to be processed after a simulation to extract these observables. One of the main challenges in post-processing PB simulations is managing the large amounts of data typically generated without incurring memory or computational capacity limitations. In this work, we introduce the post-processing tool: MDSuite. This software, developed in Python, combines state-of-the-art computing technologies such as TensorFlow, with modern data management tools such as HDF5 and SQL for a fast, scalable, and accurate PB data processing engine. This package, built around the principles of FAIR data, provides a memory safe, parallelized, and GPU accelerated environment for the analysis of particle simulations. The software currently offers 17 calculators for the computation of properties including diffusion coefficients, thermal conductivity, viscosity, radial distribution functions, coordination numbers, and more. Further, the object-oriented framework allows for the rapid implementation of new calculators or file-readers for different simulation software. The Python front-end provides a familiar interface for many users in the scientific community and a mild learning curve for the inexperienced. Future developments will include the introduction of more analysis associated with ab-initio methods, colloidal/macroscopic particle methods, and extension to experimental data."
"Practical Large-Scale Proof-Of-Stake Asynchronous Total-Order Broadcast.","2023","AFT","Orestis Alpos, Christian Cachin, Simon Holmgaard Kamp, Jesper Buus Nielsen","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/aft/AlposCKN23","We present simple and practical protocols for generating randomness as used by asynchronous total-order broadcast. The protocols are secure in a proof-of-stake setting with dynamically changing stake. They can be plugged into existing protocols for asynchronous total-order broadcast and will turn these into asynchronous total-order broadcast with dynamic stake. Our contribution relies on two important techniques. The paper “Random Oracles in Constantinople: Practical Asynchronous Byzantine Agreement using Cryptography” [Cachin, Kursawe, and Shoup, PODC 2000] has influenced the design of practical total-order broadcast through its use of threshold cryptography. However, it needs a setup protocol to be efficient. In a proof-of-stake setting with dynamic stake this setup would have to be continually recomputed, making the protocol impractical. The work “Asynchronous Byzantine Agreement with Subquadratic Communication” [Blum, Katz, Liu-Zhang, and Loss, TCC 2020] showed how to use an initial setup for broadcast to asymptotically efficiently generate sub-sequent setups. The protocol, however, resorted to fully homomorphic encryption and was therefore not practically efficient. We adopt their approach to the proof-of-stake setting with dynamic stake, apply it to the Constantinople paper, and remove the need for fully homomorphic encryption. This results in simple and practical proof-of-stake protocols. 2012 ACM"
"Towards a phenomenological understanding of neural networks: data.","2023","Mach. Learn. Sci. Technol.","Samuel Tovey, Sven Krippendorf, Konstantin Nikolaou, Christian Holm","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/mlst/ToveyKNH23","A theory of neural networks (NNs) built upon collective variables would provide scientists with the tools to better understand the learning process at every stage. In this work, we introduce two such variables, the entropy and the trace of the empirical neural tangent kernel (NTK) built on the training data passed to the model. We empirically analyze the NN performance in the context of these variables and find that there exists correlation between the starting entropy, the trace of the NTK, and the generalization of the model computed after training is complete. This framework is then applied to the problem of optimal data selection for the training of NNs. To this end, random network distillation (RND) is used as a means of selecting training data which is then compared with random selection of data. It is shown that not only does RND select data-sets capable of outperforming random selection, but that the collective variables associated with the RND data-sets are larger than those of the randomly selected sets. The results of this investigation provide a stable ground from which the selection of data for NN training can be driven by this phenomenological framework."

We derive parameter-dependent Lipschitz bounds for quantum models with trainable encoding, showing that the norm of the data encoding has a crucial impact on the robustness against data perturbations. Further, we derive a bound on the generalization error which explicitly involves the parameters of the data encoding. Our theoretical findings give rise to a practical strategy for training robust and generalizable quantum models by regularizing the Lipschitz bound in the cost. Further, we show that, for fixed and non-trainable encodings, as those frequently employed in quantum machine learning, the Lipschitz bound cannot be influenced by tuning the parameters. Thus, trainable encodings are crucial for systematically adapting robustness and generalization during training. The practical implications of our theoretical findings are illustrated with numerical results."

"Robustness of quantum algorithms against coherent control errors.","2023","CoRR","Julian Berberich, Daniel Fink, Christian Holm","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2303-00618","Coherent control errors, for which ideal Hamiltonians are perturbed by unknown multiplicative noise terms, are a major obstacle for reliable quantum computing. In this paper, we present a framework for analyzing the robustness of quantum algorithms against coherent control errors using Lipschitz bounds. We derive worst-case fidelity bounds which show that the resilience against coherent control errors is mainly influenced by the norms of the Hamiltonians generating the individual gates. These bounds are explicitly computable even for large circuits, and they can be used to guarantee fault-tolerance via threshold theorems. Moreover, we apply our theoretical framework to derive a novel guideline for robust quantum algorithm design and transpilation, which amounts to reducing the norms of the Hamiltonians. Using the $3$-qubit Quantum Fourier Transform as an example application, we demonstrate that this guideline targets robustness more effectively than existing ones based on circuit depth or gate count. Furthermore, we apply our framework to study the effect of parameter regularization in variational quantum algorithms. The practicality of the theoretical results is demonstrated via implementations in simulation and on a quantum computer."
