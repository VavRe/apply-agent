"Advancing Question Answering on Handwritten Documents: A State-of-the-Art Recognition-Based Model for HW-SQuAD.","2024","CoRR","Aniket Pal, Ajoy Mondal, C. V. Jawahar","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2406-17437","Question-answering handwritten documents is a challenging task with numerous real-world applications. This paper proposes a novel recognition-based approach that improves upon the previous state-of-the-art on the HW-SQuAD and BenthamQA datasets. Our model incorporates transformer-based document retrieval and ensemble methods at the model level, achieving an Exact Match score of 82.02% and 69% in HW-SQuAD and BenthamQA datasets, respectively, surpassing the previous best recognition-based approach by 10.89% and 3%. We also enhance the document retrieval component, boosting the top-5 retrieval accuracy from 90% to 95.30%. Our results demonstrate the significance of our proposed approach in advancing question answering on handwritten documents. The code and trained models will be publicly available to facilitate future research in this critical area of natural language."

"A Palm Index and Hand Gesture-Based User Authentication System.","2023","ICCCNT","Sudipto Das, Aniket Kumar, Disha Mukhopadhyay, Arpita Talukdar, Raja Karmakar, Twinkle Chatterjee","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/icccnt/DasKMTKC23","Hand gesture recognition has emerged as an exciting technology that offers a more authentic and interpersonal way of human-machine interaction. This work proposes a new authentication method for Internet of Things (IoT) devices based on palm index and gesture recognition. The aim is to explore the possibility of a contactless authentication approach that overcomes the limitations of traditional methods like PIN passwords. The proposed approach involves capturing a series of palm index photographs and using the length between the palm index as the user’s password. At first, a password is created for a user using the length between his palm index. The user’s authentication is confirmed by the recognized hand gesture, where the password previously generated from the palm index is verified. If the password is matched, the system is unlocked for the user. Therefore, the proposed mechanism has a much stronger password strength compared to traditional PIN passwords. Moreover, the proposed authentication method is also resistant to physical observation threats. The performance of the proposed model is analyzed through a Raspberry Pi-based real life implementation, where it is observed that the user authentication can be performed correctly."

"DenseBAM-GI: Attention Augmented DeneseNet with momentum aided GRU for HMER.","2023","CoRR","Aniket Pal, Krishna Pratap Singh","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2306-16482","The task of recognising Handwritten Mathematical Expressions (HMER) is crucial in the fields of digital education and scholarly research. However, it is difficult to accurately determine the length and complex spatial relationships among symbols in handwritten mathematical expressions. In this study, we present a novel encoder-decoder architecture (DenseBAM-GI) for HMER, where the encoder has a Bottleneck Attention Module (BAM) to improve feature representation and the decoder has a Gated Input-GRU (GI-GRU) unit with an extra gate to make decoding long and complex expressions easier. The proposed model is an efficient and lightweight architecture with performance equivalent to state-of-the-art models in terms of Expression Recognition Rate (exprate). It also performs better in terms of top 1, 2, and 3 error accuracy across the CROHME 2014, 2016, and 2019 datasets. DenseBAM-GI achieves the best exprate among all models on the CROHME 2019 dataset. Importantly, these successes are accomplished with a drop in the complexity of the calculation and a reduction in the need for GPU memory."

"Detection of Security and Privacy Attacks Disrupting User Immersive Experience in Virtual Reality Learning Environments.","2023","IEEE Trans. Serv. Comput.","Samaikya Valluripally, Benjamin Frailey, Brady Kruse, Boonakij Palipatana, Roland Oruche, Aniket Gulhane, Khaza Anuarul Hoque, Prasad Calyam","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/tsc/ValluripallyFKPOGHC23","Virtual Reality Learning Environments (VRLEs) are a new form of immersive environments which are integrated with wearable devices for delivering distance learning content in a collaborative manner in e.g., special education, surgical training. Gaining unauthorized access to these connected devices can cause security, privacy attacks (SP) that adversely impacts the user immersive experience (UIX). In this article, we identify potential SP attack surfaces that impact the application usability and immersion experience, and propose a novel anomaly detection method to detect attacks before the UIX can be disrupted. Specifically, we apply: (i) machine learning techniques such as a multi-label KNN classification algorithm to detect anomaly events of network-based attacks that include potential threat scenarios of DoS (packet tampering, packet drop, packet duplication), and (ii) statistical analysis techniques that use a combination of boolean and threshold functions (Z-scores) to detect an anomaly related to application-based attacks (Unauthorized access). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed anomaly detection method using a VRLE application case study viz., vSocial, specifically designed for teaching youth with learning impediments about social cues and interactions. Based on our detection results, we validate the impact of network and application based SP attacks on the VRLE UIX."

 Scholarly publications are key to the transfer of knowledge from scholars to others. However, research papers are information-dense, and as the volume of the scientific literature grows, the greater the need for new technology to support scholars. In contrast to the process of
 finding
 papers, which has been transformed by Internet technology, the experience of
 reading
 research papers has changed little in decades. For instance, the PDF format for sharing papers remains widely used due to its portability but has significant downsides, inter alia, static content and poor accessibility for low-vision readers. This paper explores the question “Can recent advances in AI and HCI power intelligent, interactive, and accessible reading interfaces—even for legacy PDFs?” We describe the Semantic Reader Project, a collaborative effort across multiple institutions to explore automatic creation of dynamic reading interfaces for research papers. Through this project, we’ve developed a collection of novel reading interfaces and evaluated them with study participants and real-world users to show improved reading experiences for scholars. We’ve also released a production research paper reading interface that will continuously incorporate novel features from our research as they mature. We structure this paper around five key opportunities for AI assistance in scholarly reading —discovery, efficiency, comprehension, synthesis, and accessibility—and present an overview of our progress and discuss remaining open challenges.
