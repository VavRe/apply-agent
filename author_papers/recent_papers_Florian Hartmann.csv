"Can LLMs get help from other LLMs without revealing private information?","2024","CoRR","Florian Hartmann, Duc-Hieu Tran, Peter Kairouz, Victor Carbune, Blaise Agüera y Arcas","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2404-01041","Cascades are a common type of machine learning systems in which a large, remote model can be queried if a local model is not able to accurately label a user’s data by itself. Serving stacks for large language models (LLMs) increasingly use cascades due to their ability to preserve task performance while dramatically reducing inference costs. However, applying cascade systems in situations where the local model has access to sensitive data constitutes a significant privacy risk for users since such data could be forwarded to the remote model. In this work, we show the feasibility of applying cascade systems in such setups by equipping the local model with privacy-preserving techniques that reduce the risk of leaking private information when querying the remote model. To quantify information leakage in such setups, we introduce two privacy measures. We then propose a system that leverages the recently introduced social learning paradigm in which LLMs collaboratively learn from each other by exchanging natural language. Using this paradigm, we demonstrate on several datasets that our methods minimize the privacy loss while at the same time improving task performance compared to a non-cascade baseline."
"Estimating Canopy Interception Water Storage with GNSS-Transmissometry.","2024","IGARSS","Konstantin Schellenberg, Thomas Jagdhuber, David Chaparro, Oliver Binks, Florian M. Hellwig, Clémence Dubois, Mehmet Kurum, Adriano Camps, Henrik Hartmann, Christiane Schmullius","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/igarss/SchellenbergJCBHDKCHS24","Storage of interception water in the canopy (Sc) heavily affects measurements of vegetation optical depth (VOD) from rain, dew and fog, impeding the direct retrieval of tree physiological parameters such as biomass and plant water content. This study presents a time series decomposition of VOD from Global Navigation Satellite System-Transmissometry (GNSS-T) into biomass, plant moisture content (Mg) and Sc. The experiment was conducted at eddy covariance (EC) towers in two temperate forest types in Germany, over the entire vegetation period of 2023 and under fairly wet conditions. Sc-values were 1.5 times (needleleaf) to two times (broadleaf) higher than the average diurnal Mg cycle, allowing partitioning of interception water storage from plant water. Furthermore, we found indications that Sc maxima did not linearly increase with precipitation, suggesting sensitivity of VOD to saturation effects when canopy interception storage reaches a maximum during strong precipitation events. Results indicate the sensitivity of VOD from GNSS-T to canopy wetness. This allows partitioning of canopy water storage from other VOD components and improves the usefulness of VOD as a remote sensing metric for forest canopy water relations. Moreover, it opens pathways to quantify Sc and evaporation fluxes independently from EC measurements and field experiments."
"Highly agile flat swimming robot.","2024","CoRR","Florian Hartmann, Mrudhula Baskaran, Gaetan Raynaud, Mehdi Benbedda, Karen Mulleners, Herbert Shea","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2406-08015","Exploring bodies of water on their surface allows robots to efficiently communicate and harvest energy from the sun. On the water surface, however, robots often face highly unstructured environments, cluttered with plant matter, animals, and debris. We report a fast (5.1 cm/s translation and 195 {\deg}/s rotation), centimeter-scale swimming robot with high maneuverability and autonomous untethered operation. Locomotion is enabled by a pair of soft, millimeter-thin, undulating pectoral fins, in which traveling waves are electrically excited to generate propulsion. The robots navigate through narrow spaces, through grassy plants, and push objects weighing over 16x their body weight. Such robots can allow distributed environmental monitoring as well as continuous measurement of plant and water parameters for aqua-farming."

However, the highly technical nature of logbook entries can hinder their usability and automation. As natural language processing (NLP) continues advancing, it offers opportunities to address various challenges that logbooks present. This work explores jointly testing a tailored Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) model for enhancing the usability of particle accelerator logbooks at institutes like DESY, BESSY, Fermilab, BNL, SLAC, LBNL, and CERN. The RAG model uses a corpus built on logbook contributions and aims to unlock insights from these logbooks by leveraging retrieval over facility datasets, including discussion about potential multimodal sources. Our goals are to increase the FAIR-ness (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability) of logbooks by exploiting their information content to streamline everyday use, enable macro-analysis for root cause analysis, and facilitate problem-solving automation."

"FCAS Ethical AI Demonstrator.","2023","xAI","Florian Osswald, Roman Bartolosch, Torsten Fiolka, Engelbert Hartmann, Bernhard Krach, Jan Feil, Martin Lederer","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/xai/OsswaldBFHKFL23","While artificial intelligence (AI) has become part of more and more areas of daily life – both private and business – this development has not yet progressed as far in the military sector. This is just changing with the development of new projects, such as the Future Combat Air System (FCAS) – a highly ambitious European defense project planned as a replacement of systems such as the Eurofighter from 2040 onwards. To facilitate and accelerate discussions on the ethical implications of the use of AI in the military domain, we developed the FCAS Ethical AI Demonstrator. We chose the Target Detection, Recognition, and Identification as one highly probable use case and implemented a simulation to showcase the ethical implications of the collaboration between the operator and an AI-assisted system in that application. To help the operator understand and assess the classifications of the used automatic target recognition, explanations of the AI results are computed with an Explainable AI (XAI) method and then provided in the user interface. With this hands-on demonstrator, we are pleased to contribute to the discussions on the ethical implications of the use of AI in military applications."

"Practical Non-Invasive Probing Attacks Against Novel Carbon-Nanotube-Based Physical Unclonable Functions.","2023","CoRR","Nikolaos Athanasios Anagnostopoulos, Alexander Braml, Nico Mexis, Florian Frank 0004, Simon Böttger, Martin Hartmann, Sascha Hermann, Elif Bilge Kavun, Stefan Katzenbeisser 0001, Tolga Arul","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2307-01041","As the number of devices being interconnected increases, so does also the demand for (lightweight) security. To this end, Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) have been proposed as hardware primitives that can act as roots of trust and security. Recently, a new type of PUF based on Carbon NanoTubes (CNTs) has been proposed. At the same time, attacks and testing based on direct electrical probing appear to be moving towards non-invasive techniques. In this context, this work attempts to examine the potential for practical non-invasive probing attacks against the CNT-PUF, a novel PUF based on CNTs. Our results indicate that direct probing might potentially compromise the security of this PUF. Nevertheless, we note that this holds true only in the case that the attacker can directly probe the wire corresponding to the secret value of each CNT-PUF cell. Thus, we can conclude that the examined CNT-PUFs are rather resilient to direct probing attacks, that non-invasive probing methods appear to be promising for testing such PUFs, and that, in order for the attacker to gain the full-length value of the secret, all the relevant channels would need to be probed. Nevertheless, as our work proves, practical non-invasive attacks against the CNT-PUF are feasible and adequate countermeasures need to be employed in order to address this issue."
"Social Learning: Towards Collaborative Learning with Large Language Models.","2023","CoRR","Amirkeivan Mohtashami, Florian Hartmann, Sian Gooding, Lukas Zilka, Matthew Sharifi, Blaise Agüera y Arcas","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2312-11441","We introduce the framework of""social learning""in the context of large language models (LLMs), whereby models share knowledge with each other in a privacy-aware manner using natural language. We present and evaluate two approaches for knowledge transfer between LLMs. In the first scenario, we allow the model to generate abstract prompts aiming to teach the task. In our second approach, models transfer knowledge by generating synthetic examples. We evaluate these methods across diverse datasets and quantify memorization as a proxy for privacy loss. These techniques inspired by social learning yield promising results with low memorization of the original data. In particular, we show that performance using these methods is comparable to results with the use of original labels and prompts. Our work demonstrates the viability of social learning for LLMs, establishes baseline approaches and highlights several unexplored areas for future work."
"Spatial Correlation in Weak Physical Unclonable Functions: A Comprehensive Overview.","2023","DSD","Nico Mexis, Tolga Arul, Nikolaos Athanasios Anagnostopoulos, Florian Frank 0004, Simon Böttger, Martin Hartmann, Sascha Hermann, Elif Bilge Kavun, Stefan Katzenbeisser 0001","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/dsd/MexisAAFBHHKK23","Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) are increasingly used in the process of securing applications. For this purpose, it is crucial that the PUF satisfies all the required properties adequately, including Unpredictability. An important aspect of Unpredictability is Randomness, which includes being free of spatial correlation effects. However, most methods for assessing randomness are not capable of detecting correlation, such that this aspect is often ignored. This work summarises the current literature to shed more light on the topic of analysing spatial correlation in weak PUFs, and evaluates the various methods proposed in the literature for detecting such effects. Additionally, the spatial correlation of a Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) decay-based PUF implemented on the DRAM of a Raspberry Pi board, as well as that of a Carbon-NanoTube-based PUF (CNT-PUF), are examined, using, for the first time in the context of PUFs, not only other well-known metrics proposed in the relevant literature, but also the Getis-Ord G metric. Finally, a mitigation technique against attacks based on spatial auto-correlation is proposed and its effective application to PUF responses is discussed."
