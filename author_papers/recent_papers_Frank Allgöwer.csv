"A Window-Based Periodic Event-Triggered Consensus Scheme for Multiagent Systems.","2024","IEEE Trans. Control. Netw. Syst.","Marc Seidel, Michael Hertneck, Pian Yu, Steffen Linsenmayer, Dimos V. Dimarogonas, Frank Allgöwer","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/tcns/SeidelHYLDA24","In this article, we consider the periodic event-triggered consensus problem for single-integrator multiagent systems. In existing approaches, consensus is typically achieved by trigger schemes enforcing a monotone decrease of a Lyapunov function. Such trigger schemes may, however, result in more transmissions than are actually required to ensure consensus or meet certain performance specifications. This is because a monotone decrease may be a rather conservative condition for a given Lyapunov function in an event-triggered setting. To overcome the conservativity, we propose a novel window-based trigger scheme, which allows us to leverage existing trigger schemes from the literature to derive less conservative ones. This is achieved by taking the past system behavior into account and allowing a temporary increase of the Lyapunov function as long as a decreasing tendency is still guaranteed. For that, information from previous time steps within certain time windows is considered. We provide an explicit bound on the evolution of the Lyapunov function that is the same for the window-based scheme and the (monotone) original trigger schemes. To illustrate the benefits of the window-based scheme, we validate its efficacy through a comprehensive simulation study and demonstrate that the scheme typically reduces the average update rate of the underlying communication structure in comparison to the original trigger schemes."

When applying data-driven controllers in real-world applications, providing theoretical guarantees for the closed-loop system is of crucial importance to ensure reliable operation. In this review, we provide an overview of data-driven model predictive control (MPC) methods for controlling unknown systems with guarantees on systems-theoretic properties such as stability, robustness, and constraint satisfaction. The considered approaches rely on the fundamental lemma from behavioral theory in order to predict input–output trajectories directly from data. We cover various setups, ranging from linear systems and noise-free data to more realistic formulations with noise and nonlinearities, and we provide an overview of different techniques to ensure guarantees for the closed-loop system. Moreover, we discuss avenues for future research that may further improve the theoretical understanding and practical applicability of data-driven MPC."

Lett.","Sebastian Schlor, Frank Allgöwer","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/csysl/SchlorA24","Encrypted dynamic controllers that operate for an unlimited time have been a challenging research subject. The fundamental difficulty is the accumulation of errors and scaling factors in the internal state during operation. Bootstrapping, a technique commonly employed in fully homomorphic cryptosystems, can be used to avoid overflows in the controller state but can potentially introduce significant numerical errors. This letter analyzes dynamic encrypted control with explicit consideration of bootstrapping. By recognizing the bootstrapping errors occurring in the controller’s state as an uncertainty in the robust control framework, we can provide stability and performance guarantees for the whole encrypted control system. Further, the conservatism of the stability and performance test is reduced by using a lifted version of the control system."

To tackle these drawbacks, we establish a polynomial representation of nonlinear functions based on a polynomial sector by Taylor's theorem and a set-membership for Taylor polynomials. The latter is obtained from finite noisy samples. By incorporating the measurement noise, the error of polynomial approximation, and potentially given prior knowledge on the structure of the system dynamics, we achieve computationally tractable conditions by sum of squares relaxation to verify dissipativity of nonlinear dynamical systems with rigorous guarantees. The framework is extended by combining multiple Taylor polynomial approximations, which yields a less conservative piecewise polynomial system representation. The proposed approach is applied for an experimental example. There it is compared with a least-squares-error model including knowledge from first principle."

The closed-loop system is considered as a feedback interconnection of two subsystems: one describes the behavior of the system state and the other the sampling-induced error. An IQC for the sampling-induced error is used as the ETC triggering rule. Transmissions are triggered if this IQC would otherwise be violated. We provide a method to synthesize the multiplier for the IQC based on linear matrix inequalities, such that asymptotic stability and a lower bound on the inter-event times are guaranteed. Moreover, the proposed approach allows for the incorporation of additional performance criteria to ensure further properties of the closed-loop system, such as a bound on the ${{\mathcal {L}}}_{2}$ -gain."
"How improving performance may imply losing consistency in event-triggered consensus.","2024","CoRR","David Meister, Duarte J. Antunes, Frank Allgöwer","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2405-03245","Event-triggered control is often argued to lower the average triggering rate compared to time-triggered control while still achieving a desired control goal, e.g., the same performance level. However, this property, often called consistency, cannot be taken for granted and can be hard to analyze in many settings. In particular, although numerous decentralized event-triggered control schemes have been proposed in the past years, their performance properties with respect to time-triggered control remain mostly unexplored. In this paper, we therefore examine the performance properties of event-triggered control (relative to time-triggered control) for a single-integrator consensus problem with a level-triggering rule. We consider the long-term average quadratic deviation from consensus as a performance measure. For this setting, we show that enriching the information the local controllers use improves the performance of the consensus algorithm but renders a previously consistent event-triggered control scheme inconsistent. In addition, we do so while deploying optimal control inputs which we derive for both information cases and all triggering schemes. With this insight, we can furthermore explain the relationship between two contrasting consistency results from the literature on decentralized event-triggered control. We support our theoretical findings with simulation results."

Specifically, the LipSDP approach (Fazlyab et al., 2019) has received much attention and provides the least conservative Lipschitz upper bounds that can be computed with polynomial time guarantees. However, one main restriction of LipSDP is that its formulation requires the activation functions to be slope-restricted on $[0,1]$, preventing its further use for more general activation functions such as GroupSort, MaxMin, and Householder. One can rewrite MaxMin activations for example as residual ReLU networks. However, a direct application of LipSDP to the resultant residual ReLU networks is conservative and even fails in recovering the well-known fact that the MaxMin activation is 1-Lipschitz. Our paper bridges this gap and extends LipSDP beyond slope-restricted activation functions. To this end, we provide novel quadratic constraints for GroupSort, MaxMin, and Householder activations via leveraging their underlying properties such as sum preservation. Our proposed analysis is general and provides a unified approach for estimating $\ell_2$ and $\ell_\infty$ Lipschitz bounds for a rich class of neural network architectures, including non-residual and residual neural networks and implicit models, with GroupSort, MaxMin, and Householder activations. Finally, we illustrate the utility of our approach with a variety of experiments and show that our proposed SDPs generate less conservative Lipschitz bounds in comparison to existing approaches."
"On discount functions for economic model predictive control without terminal conditions.","2024","CoRR","Lukas Schwenkel, Daniel Briem, Matthias A. Müller 0001, Frank Allgöwer","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2405-14361","In this paper, we investigate discounted economic model predictive control (E-MPC) schemes without terminal conditions in scenarios where the optimal operating behavior is a periodic orbit. For such a setting, it is known that a linearly discounted stage cost guarantees asymptotic stability of any arbitrarily small neighborhood of the optimal orbit if the prediction horizon is sufficiently long. However, in some examples very long prediction horizons are needed to achieve the desired performance. In this work, we extend these results by providing the same qualitative stability guarantees for a large class of discount functions. Numerical examples illustrate the influence of the discount function and show that with suitable discounting we can achieve significantly better performance than the linearly discounted E-MPC, even for short prediction horizons."

"State space representations of the Roesser type for convolutional layers.","2024","CoRR","Patricia Pauli, Dennis Gramlich, Frank Allgöwer","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2403-11938","From the perspective of control theory, convolutional layers (of neural networks) are 2-D (or N-D) linear time-invariant dynamical systems. The usual representation of convolutional layers by the convolution kernel corresponds to the representation of a dynamical system by its impulse response. However, many analysis tools from control theory, e.g., involving linear matrix inequalities, require a state space representation. For this reason, we explicitly provide a state space representation of the Roesser type for 2-D convolutional layers with $c_\mathrm{in}r_1 + c_\mathrm{out}r_2$ states, where $c_\mathrm{in}$/$c_\mathrm{out}$ is the number of input/output channels of the layer and $r_1$/$r_2$ characterizes the width/length of the convolution kernel. This representation is shown to be minimal for $c_\mathrm{in} = c_\mathrm{out}$. We further construct state space representations for dilated, strided, and N-D convolutions."
"Dynamic Deterministic Quality of Service Model with Behavior-Adaptive Latency Bounds.","2023","RTCSA","Robin Laidig, Frank Dürr, Kurt Rothermel, Stefan Wildhagen, Frank Allgöwer","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/rtcsa/LaidigDRWA23","Many time-sensitive networked systems, such as networked control systems or other cyber/physical systems, require well-defined Quality of Service (QoS) with guaranteed deterministic bounds on network delay. Existing QoS models typically provide no guarantees for excess traffic beyond the traffic specified during the initial admission process. This can lead to a waste of resources when applications overcompensate during resource reservation to avoid traffic violations. In this work, we propose the Dynamic Priority Token Bucket (DPTB), a fundamentally different new QoS model. DPTB permits short-time violations without immediately dropping to best-effort guarantees for excess traffic. Instead, the priority of the application gets degraded to weaker but still deterministic guarantees. At any point in time, the application can calculate the currently guaranteed delay bounds, which depend only on its own past sending behavior, to enable application-level adaptation of the sending rate and application-side prediction of the implications onto the application performance. We designed DPTB as a token bucket extension that can be used on top of several existing scheduling mechanisms, such as the Asynchronous Traffic Shaper of IEEE Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN). Our evaluations show that DPTB is more resilient to bursty cross-traffic, resulting in significantly lower average delays than regular reservations."

In addition, we propose an offset cost that is applicable to general nonconvex steady-state manifolds. The resulting MPC scheme is simple to implement since it does not require the design of terminal ingredients (i.e., terminal controller, terminal cost, and terminal region) and is applicable to general (possibly unreachable) output specifications. We show the benefits of the proposed approach by means of a numerical example where we compare it with the state-of-the-art tracking MPC formulation."

Based on these local dissipativity properties and the interconnection structure, a corresponding (approximate) dissipativity property for the overall system is inferred, which is structured and provides performance bounds for overall system operation. The resulting structured dissipativity property is exploited in the design and analysis of a distributed economic MPC algorithm.

In particular, due to the finite horizon of the MPC scheme and to the presence of disturbances, the open-loop trajectory usually differs from the closed-loop one. Such a mismatch causes existing learning-based MPC schemes to only show a learning phase in the open-loop prediction, without providing any formal guarantee on the actual closed-loop learning. In this article, we show how existing MPC schemes can be easily modified in order to guarantee closed-loop learning of the system by including a suitable discount factor in the chosen learning cost function, and implementing an additional constraint in the original MPC scheme. We show that various techniques for online learning the system dynamics, such as kinky inference methods, Gaussian processes, or parametric approaches, can be used within the proposed general framework."

On the contrary, the backup trajectory lies in the known space, and is intended to ensure safety and convergence. The cost function for the learning trajectory is divided into a tracking and an offset cost, while the cost function for the backup trajectory is only marginally considered and only penalizes the offset cost. We show that the proposed MPC scheme is not only able to safely explore the unknown constraints but also escape from local minima that may arise from the presence of obstacles. Moreover, we provide formal guarantees for convergence and recursive feasibility of the MPC scheme, as well as closed-loop constraint satisfaction.

In addition, its offset is penalised in the MPC optimisation problem, leading to closed-loop convergence to the best reachable reference. In this letter, we provide a transient performance bound on the closed loop using MPC for tracking. We employ mild assumptions on the offset cost and scale it with the prediction horizon.

However, it has proven difficult to characterize the traffic produced by ETC a priori. Rollout ETC addresses this issue by using a triggering and control law that is implicitly defined by the solution to an optimal control problem (OCP), instead of an explicit one as in classical ETC. This allows to directly incorporate predefined constraints on the transmission traffic as well as on states and inputs. In this article, we examine the practically relevant case when outputs instead of state measurements are available, and measurements as well as the LTI plant are subject to uncertainties. To address these challenges, we adapt methods from robust tube-based model predictive control and propose three different strategies to implement an error feedback in an NCSs setup, the applicability of which depends on the capabilities of the actuator. We establish recursive feasibility, robust constraint satisfaction, and convergence. Finally, we illustrate our results in a numerical example."

To this end, the usual description of convolutional layers with convolution kernels, i.e., the impulse responses of linear filters, is realized in state space as a linear time-invariant 2-D system. The overall convolutional Neural Network composed of convolutional layers and nonlinear activation functions is then viewed as a 2-D version of a Lur'e system, i.e., a linear dynamical system interconnected with static nonlinear components. One benefit of this 2-D Lur'e system perspective on CNNs is that we can use robust control theory much more efficiently for Lipschitz constant estimation than previously possible."
"Data-Driven Min-Max MPC for Linear Systems.","2023","CoRR","Yifan Xie, Julian Berberich, Frank Allgöwer","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2309-17307","Designing data-driven controllers in the presence of noise is an important research problem, in particular when guarantees on stability, robustness, and constraint satisfaction are desired. In this paper, we propose a data-driven min-max model predictive control (MPC) scheme to design state-feedback controllers from noisy data for unknown linear time-invariant (LTI) system. The considered min-max problem minimizes the worst-case cost over the set of system matrices consistent with the data. We show that the resulting optimization problem can be reformulated as a semidefinite program (SDP). By solving the SDP, we obtain a state-feedback control law that stabilizes the closed-loop system and guarantees input and state constraint satisfaction. A numerical example demonstrates the validity of our theoretical results."
"Data-driven Dissipativity Analysis of Linear Parameter-Varying Systems.","2023","CoRR","Chris Verhoek, Julian Berberich, Sofie Haesaert, Frank Allgöwer, Roland Tóth","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2303-10031","We derive direct data-driven dissipativity analysis methods for Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) systems using a single sequence of input-scheduling-output data. By means of constructing a semi-definite program subject to linear matrix inequality constraints based on this data-dictionary, direct data-driven verification of $(Q,S,R)$-type of dissipativity properties of the data-generating LPV system is achieved. Multiple implementation methods are proposed to achieve efficient computational properties and to even exploit structural information on the scheduling, e.g., rate bounds. The effectiveness and trade-offs of the proposed methodologies are shown in simulation studies of academic and physically realistic examples."
"Decrypting Nonlinearity: Koopman Interpretation and Analysis of Cryptosystems.","2023","CoRR","Robin Strässer, Sebastian Schlor, Frank Allgöwer","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2311-12714","Public-key cryptosystems rely on computationally difficult problems for security, traditionally analyzed using number theory methods. In this paper, we introduce a novel perspective on cryptosystems by viewing the Diffie-Hellman key exchange and the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman cryptosystem as nonlinear dynamical systems. By applying Koopman theory, we transform these dynamical systems into higher-dimensional spaces and analytically derive equivalent purely linear systems. This formulation allows us to reconstruct the secret integers of the cryptosystems through straightforward manipulations, leveraging the tools available for linear systems analysis. Additionally, we establish an upper bound on the minimum lifting dimension required to achieve perfect accuracy. Our results on the required lifting dimension are in line with the intractability of brute-force attacks. To showcase the potential of our approach, we establish connections between our findings and existing results on algorithmic complexity. Furthermore, we extend this methodology to a data-driven context, where the Koopman representation is learned from data samples of the cryptosystems."

"Koopman-based feedback design with stability guarantees.","2023","CoRR","Robin Strässer, Manuel Schaller, Karl Worthmann, Julian Berberich, Frank Allgöwer","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2312-01441","We present a method to design a state-feedback controller ensuring exponential stability for nonlinear systems using only measurement data. Our approach relies on Koopman-operator theory and uses robust control to explicitly account for approximation errors due to finitely many data samples. To simplify practical usage across various applications, we provide a tutorial-style exposition of the feedback design and its stability guarantees for single-input systems. Moreover, we extend this controller design to multi-input systems and more flexible nonlinear state-feedback controllers using gain-scheduling techniques to increase the guaranteed region of attraction. As the proposed controller design is framed as a semidefinite program, it allows for an efficient solution. Further, we enhance the geometry of the region of attraction through a heuristic algorithm that establishes a connection between the employed Koopman lifting and the dynamics of the system. Finally, we validate the proposed feedback design procedure by means of numerical examples."

In doing so, we use the Lipschitz constant of the input-output mapping characterized by a CNN as a robustness measure. We base our parameterization on the Cayley transform that parameterizes orthogonal matrices and the controllability Gramian of the state space representation of the convolutional layers. The proposed parameterization by design fulfills linear matrix inequalities that are sufficient for Lipschitz continuity of the CNN, which further enables unconstrained training of Lipschitz-bounded 1D CNNs. Finally, we train Lipschitz-bounded 1D CNNs for the classification of heart arrythmia data and show their improved robustness."
