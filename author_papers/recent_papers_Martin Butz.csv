"Beyond Recommendations: From Backward to Forward AI Support of Pilots' Decision-Making Process.","2024","CoRR","Zelun Tony Zhang, Sebastian S. Feger, Lucas Dullenkopf, Rulu Liao, Lukas Süsslin, Yuanting Liu, Andreas Butz","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2406-08959","AI is anticipated to enhance human decision-making in high-stakes domains like aviation, but adoption is often hindered by challenges such as inappropriate reliance and poor alignment with users' decision-making. Recent research suggests that a core underlying issue is the recommendation-centric design of many AI systems, i.e., they give end-to-end recommendations and ignore the rest of the decision-making process. Alternative support paradigms are rare, and it remains unclear how the few that do exist compare to recommendation-centric support. In this work, we aimed to empirically compare recommendation-centric support to an alternative paradigm, continuous support, in the context of diversions in aviation. We conducted a mixed-methods study with 32 professional pilots in a realistic setting. To ensure the quality of our study scenarios, we conducted a focus group with four additional pilots prior to the study. We found that continuous support can support pilots' decision-making in a forward direction, allowing them to think more beyond the limits of the system and make faster decisions when combined with recommendations, though the forward support can be disrupted. Participants' statements further suggest a shift in design goal away from providing recommendations, to supporting quick information gathering. Our results show ways to design more helpful and effective AI decision support that goes beyond end-to-end recommendations."

"Integrating Crowd and Machine Learning in an Intelligent Interface: A Case Study of Oil Spill Detection in Satellite Images.","2024","AVI","Rifat Mehreen Amin, Feng Chen, Linda Hirsch, Changkun Ou, Tran Vu La, Andreas Butz","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/avi/AminCHOLB24","Object detection tasks still often require manual image analysis. Using Machine Learning (ML) instead creates accountability challenges, necessitating experts for model refinement, which is costly and takes time. We investigate integrating crowd knowledge as a cost-effective alternative. While human capabilities in recognizing complex patterns and perceiving variations can still outperform machines and improve an imperfect ML model, ML predictions can compensate for the crowd’s lack of expertise. Our investigation (N=28 non-expert) in oil spill detection shows that adopting an ML-assisted UI elevates precision and recall by over 11% and increases efficiency by 29% compared to a non-assisted UI. Considering agreement among non-expert crowd workers further improved precision by 8% and recall by almost 5%, which is also substantially beyond pure ML performance. Our work contributes an approach for combining crowd knowledge and ML to advance human-AI collaboration in oil spill detection."
"Social MediARverse Investigating Users Social Media Content Sharing and Consuming Intentions with Location-Based AR.","2024","CoRR","Linda Hirsch, Florian Müller 0003, Mari Kruse, Andreas Butz, Robin Welsch","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2409-00211","Augmented Reality (AR) is evolving to become the next frontier in social media, merging physical and virtual reality into a living metaverse, a Social MediARverse. With this transition, we must understand how different contexts (public, semi-public, and private) affect user engagement with AR content. We address this gap in current research by conducting an online survey with 110 participants, showcasing 36 AR videos, and polling them about the content's fit and appropriateness. Specifically, we manipulated these three spaces, two forms of dynamism (dynamic vs. static), and two dimensionalities (2D vs. 3D). Our findings reveal that dynamic AR content is generally more favorably received than static content. Additionally, users find sharing and engaging with AR content in private settings more comfortable than in others. By this, the study offers valuable insights for designing and implementing future Social MediARverses and guides industry and academia on content visualization and contextual considerations."

Visualizing these big, multi-dimensional datasets poses challenges such as overplotting and dimension reduction, often rendering traditional visualization techniques inadequate. To address this, we added two machine learning (ML) algorithms (Local Outlier Factor algorithm and K-Prototypes clustering) to an interactive time series visualization to improve exploration by both domain experts and non-experts. We used an original detector dataset of a mid-sized German city. Our findings reveal that the ML algorithms greatly enhanced data exploration in these interactive visualizations, particularly for users with limited domain knowledge. This research directly contributes to the design of traffic data analysis tools, offering a foundation for traffic detection hardware and software improvements but also advancing complex dataset visualization in general. It will ultimately lead to more informed decisions, improved traffic management, and has the potential to reduce air pollutants, thus counteracting climate change."

"You Can Only Verify When You Know the Answer: Feature-Based Explanations Reduce Overreliance on AI for Easy Decisions, but Not for Hard Ones.","2024","MuC","Zelun Tony Zhang, Felicitas Buchner, Yuanting Liu, Andreas Butz","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/mc/ZhangBLB24","Explaining the mechanisms behind model predictions is a common strategy in AI-assisted decision-making to help users rely appropriately on AI. However, recent research shows that the effectiveness of explanations depends on numerous factors, leading to mixed results, with many studies finding no effect or even an increase in overreliance, while explanations do improve appropriate reliance in other studies. We consider the factor of decision difficulty to better understand when feature-based explanations can mitigate overre-liance. To this end, we conducted an online experiment ( 𝑁 = 200) with carefully selected task instances that cover a wide range of difficulties. We found that explanations reduce overreliance for easy decisions, but that this effect vanishes with increasing decision difficulty. For the most difficult decisions, explanations might even increase overreliance. Our results imply that explanations of the model’s inner workings are only helpful for a limited set of decision tasks where users easily know the answer themselves"
"A Literature Survey of How to Convey Transparency in Co-Located Human-Robot Interaction.","2023","Multimodal Technol. Interact.","Svenja Yvonne Schött, Rifat Mehreen Amin, Andreas Butz","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/mti/SchottAB23","In human–robot interaction, transparency is essential to ensure that humans understand and trust robots. Understanding is vital from an ethical perspective and benefits interaction, e.g., through appropriate trust. While there is research on explanations and their content, the methods used to convey the explanations are underexplored. It remains unclear which approaches are used to foster understanding. To this end, we contribute a systematic literature review exploring how robot transparency is fostered in papers published in the ACM Digital Library and IEEE Xplore. We found that researchers predominantly rely on monomodal visual or verbal explanations to foster understanding. Commonly, these explanations are external, as opposed to being integrated in the robot design. This paper provides an overview of how transparency is communicated in human–robot interaction research and derives a classification with concrete recommendations for communicating transparency. Our results establish a solid base for consistent, transparent human–robot interaction designs."
"An empirical study to design interactions with historical buildings used for everyday activities.","2023","KUI","Linda Hirsch, Daniel Buschek, Eileen Einwächter, Louisa Bekker, Andreas Butz","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/kui/HirschBEBB23","Many historical buildings are challenged to comply with their dual purpose of being society's living memory and being used for everyday activities, such as a place to work or study. Direct interactions with such buildings could counteract this challenge and integrate their historical significance with contemporary needs. However, there is a lack of knowledge about designing this. We approached the gap in an iterative design process by conducting four expert interviews and two building walks with N=16 building users at a public historical building. Our results highlight the importance for building users to integrate historical significance and contemporary needs into their routines to increase their connection to the building and its past users. We provide three design implications for designing the interaction with historical buildings in everyday life and emphasize research implications for future projects. Our findings emphasize the need for interdisciplinary collaboration between Human-computer interaction research areas."

In virtual reality (VR), various approaches, such as avatars, are developed for multi-player games to increase social connectedness. However, these approaches are lacking in single-player games. To increase social connectedness in such games, our work explores the visualization of physiological data from asynchronous players, i.e., electrocardiogram (ECG). We identified two visualization dimensions, the number of players, and the visualization style, after a design workshop with experts (N=4) and explored them in a single-user virtual escape room game. We spatially and temporally integrated the visualizations and compared two times two visualizations against a baseline condition without visualization in a within-subject lab study (N=34). All but one visualization significantly increased participants’ feelings of social connectedness. Heart icons triggered the strongest feeling of connectedness, understanding, and perceived support in playing the game."

However, in confined social settings like sharing a couch with seatmates, bystanders' proxemic cues, such as distance, are limited during interruptions, posing challenges for proxemic-aware systems. To address this, we investigated three visualizations, using a 2D animoji, a fully-rendered avatar, and their combination, to gradually share bystanders' orientation and location during interruptions. In a user study (N=22), participants played virtual reality games while responding to questions from their seatmates. We found that the avatar preserved game experiences yet did not support the fast identification of seatmates as the animoji did. Instead, users preferred the mixed visualization, where they found the seatmate's orientation cues instantly in their view and were gradually guided to the person's actual location. We discuss implications for fine-grained proxemic-aware virtual reality systems to support interaction in constrained social spaces."
"Short-Form Videos Degrade Our Capacity to Retain Intentions: Effect of Context Switching On Prospective Memory.","2023","CHI","Francesco Chiossi, Luke Haliburton, Changkun Ou, Andreas Martin Butz, Albrecht Schmidt 0001","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/chi/ChiossiHOB023","Social media platforms use short, highly engaging videos to catch users’ attention. While the short-form video feeds popularized by TikTok are rapidly spreading to other platforms, we do not yet understand their impact on cognitive functions. We conducted a between-subjects experiment (N = 60) investigating the impact of engaging with TikTok, Twitter, and YouTube while performing a Prospective Memory task (i.e., executing a previously planned action). The study required participants to remember intentions over interruptions. We found that the TikTok condition significantly degraded the users’ performance in this task. As none of the other conditions (Twitter, YouTube, no activity) had a similar effect, our results indicate that the combination of short videos and rapid context-switching impairs intention recall and execution. We contribute a quantified understanding of the effect of social media feed format on Prospective Memory and outline consequences for media technology designers to not harm the users’ memory and wellbeing."
"The Impact of Expertise in the Loop for Exploring Machine Rationality.","2023","IUI","Changkun Ou, Sven Mayer, Andreas Martin Butz","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/iui/OuMB23","Human-in-the-loop optimization utilizes human expertise to guide machine optimizers iteratively and search for an optimal solution in a solution space. While prior empirical studies mainly investigated novices, we analyzed the impact of the levels of expertise on the outcome quality and corresponding subjective satisfaction. We conducted a study (N=60) in text, photo, and 3D mesh optimization contexts. We found that novices can achieve an expert level of quality performance, but participants with higher expertise led to more optimization iteration with more explicit preference while keeping satisfaction low. In contrast, novices were more easily satisfied and terminated faster. Therefore, we identified that experts seek more diverse outcomes while the machine reaches optimal results, and the observed behavior can be used as a performance indicator for human-in-the-loop system designers to improve underlying models. We inform future research to be cautious about the impact of user expertise when designing human-in-the-loop systems."
"Would You Hold My Hand? Exploring External Observers' Perception of Artificial Hands.","2023","Multimodal Technol. Interact.","Svenja Yvonne Schött, Patricia Capsi-Morales, Steeven Villa, Andreas Butz, Cristina Piazza","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/mti/SchottCVBP23","Recent technological advances have enabled the development of sophisticated prosthetic hands, which can help their users to compensate lost motor functions. While research and development has mostly addressed the functional requirements and needs of users of these prostheses, their broader societal perception (e.g., by external observers not affected by limb loss themselves) has not yet been thoroughly explored. To fill this gap, we investigated how the physical design of artificial hands influences the perception by external observers. First, we conducted an online study (n = 42) to explore the emotional response of observers toward three different types of artificial hands. Then, we conducted a lab study (n = 14) to examine the influence of design factors and depth of interaction on perceived trust and usability. Our findings indicate that some design factors directly impact the trust individuals place in the system’s capabilities. Furthermore, engaging in deeper physical interactions leads to a more profound understanding of the underlying technology. Thus, our study shows the crucial role of the design features and interaction in shaping the emotions around, trust in, and perceived usability of artificial hands. These factors ultimately impact the overall perception of prosthetic systems and, hence, the acceptance of these technologies in society."

In comparison to state‐of‐the‐art (SOTA) machine learning (ML) weather forecast models, such as Pangu‐Weather and GraphCast, our DLWP‐HPX model uses coarser resolution and far fewer prognostic variables. Yet, at 1‐week lead times, its skill is only about 1 day behind both SOTA ML forecast models and the SOTA numerical weather prediction model from the European Center for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts. We report several improvements in model design, including switching from the cubed sphere to the HEALPix mesh, inverting the channel depth of the U‐Net, and introducing gated recurrent units (GRU) on each level of the U‐Net hierarchy. The consistent east‐west orientation of all cells on the HEALPix mesh facilitates the development of location‐invariant convolution kernels that successfully propagate weather patterns across the globe without requiring separate kernels for the polar and equatorial faces of the cube sphere. Without any loss of spectral power after the first 2 days, the model can be unrolled autoregressively for hundreds of steps into the future to generate realistic states of the atmosphere that respect seasonal trends, as showcased in 1‐year simulations."

Butz","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/tamd/FabiOSWKB23","With the increasing effectiveness of one-/few-shot learning techniques in the context of handwritten character generation and recognition, the call to extend the commonly associated Omniglot challenge is becoming more pressing. However, the sequential Omniglot data set represents unrealistically written characters. Therefore, we present new data, a new challenge, and a new model as follows: on the data side, we introduce DigiLeTs, a data set containing 23 870 new trajectories of Latin letters and Arabic numbers from 77 participants with high natural variance within character types. On the challenge side, we introduce the task to imitate handwriting styles in a one-shot manner. On the model side, we extend a generative, recurrent neural network model equipped with a one-shot inference mechanism that allows to reuse previously extracted compositional encodings and that has already been proven promising to solve the original Omniglot challenge. The new model is able to reassemble previously learned components into new characters of new styles in a one-shot manner. Most surprisingly, in a strictly forward manner, it often generates plausible, unknown characters in an already known style. With this work, we hope to inspire future research to investigate how compositional structures develop and are employed for rapid, concept-oriented learning, imitation, and understanding."

Butz","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2304-04664","Deep learning has gained immense popularity in the Earth sciences as it enables us to formulate purely data-driven models of complex Earth system processes. Deep learning-based weather prediction (DLWP) models have made significant progress in the last few years, achieving forecast skills comparable to established numerical weather prediction models with comparatively lesser computational costs. In order to train accurate, reliable, and tractable DLWP models with several millions of parameters, the model design needs to incorporate suitable inductive biases that encode structural assumptions about the data and the modelled processes. When chosen appropriately, these biases enable faster learning and better generalisation to unseen data. Although inductive biases play a crucial role in successful DLWP models, they are often not stated explicitly and their contribution to model performance remains unclear. Here, we review and analyse the inductive biases of state-of-the-art DLWP models with respect to five key design elements: data selection, learning objective, loss function, architecture, and optimisation method. We identify the most important inductive biases and highlight potential avenues towards more efficient and probabilistic DLWP models."
