"Modeling Languages for Automotive Digital Twins: A Survey Among the German Automotive Industry.","2024","MODELS","Jérôme Pfeiffer, Dominik Fuchß, Thomas Kühn 0001, Robin Liebhart, Dirk Neumann 0005, Christer Neimöck, Christian Seiler, Anne Koziolek, Andreas Wortmann 0001","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/models/PfeifferF0L0NSK24","The demand for digital twins and suitable modeling techniques in the automotive industry is increasing rapidly. Yet, there is no common understanding of digital twins in automotive, nor are there modeling techniques established to create automotive digital twins. Recent studies on digital twins focus on the analysis of the literature on digital twins for automotive or in general and, thus, neglect the industrial perspective of automotive practitioners. To mitigate this gap between scientific literature and the industrial perspective, we conducted a questionnaire survey among experts in the German automotive industry to identify i) the desired purposes for and capabilities of digital twins and ii) the modeling techniques related to engineering and operating digital twins across the phases of auto-motive development. To this end, we contacted 189 members of the Software-Defined Car research project and received 96 responses. The results show that digital twins are considered most useful in the usage and support phase of automotive development, representing vehicles as-operated. Moreover, simulation models, source code, and business process models are currently considered the most important models to be integrated into a digital twin alongside the associated, established"

"Visual analysis of fitness landscapes in architectural design optimization.","2024","Vis. Comput.","Moataz Abdelaal, Marcel Galuschka, Max Zorn, Fabian Kannenberg, Achim Menges, Thomas Wortmann, Daniel Weiskopf, Kuno Kurzhals","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/vc/AbdelaalGZKMWWK24","AbstractIn architectural design optimization, fitness landscapes are used to visualize design space parameters in relation to one or more objective functions for which they are being optimized. In our design study with domain experts, we developed a visual analytics framework for exploring and analyzing fitness landscapes spanning data, projection, and visualization layers. Within the data layer, we employ two surrogate models and three sampling strategies to efficiently generate a wide array of landscapes. On the projection layer, we use star coordinates and UMAP as two alternative methods for obtaining a 2D embedding of the design space. Our interactive user interface can visualize fitness landscapes as a continuous density map or a discrete glyph-based map. We investigate the influence of surrogate models and sampling strategies on the resulting fitness landscapes in a parameter study. Additionally, we present findings from a user study (N = 12), revealing how experts’ preferences regarding projection methods and visual representations may be influenced by their level of expertise, characteristics of the techniques, and the specific task at hand. Furthermore, we demonstrate the usability and usefulness of our framework by a case study from the architecture domain, involving one domain expert."
"BHoM to bhOWL converter.","2023","DaRUS","Diellza Elshani, Alessio Lombardi, Daniel Hernández 0002, Steffen Staab, Al Fisher, Thomas Wortmann","Data and Artifacts","https://dblp.org/rec/data/10/ElshaniLHSFW23","Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) projects require multidisciplinary solutions resulting in several disciplinary representations for one physical asset. However, interoperability issues between software often hinder disciplinary data integration, leading to the late recognition of violated design constraints. Buildings and Habitats object Model (BHoM) is an open-source framework initiated by Buro Happold, and it provides a unified data model for building design and construction information. Semantic Web technologies can link data effectively, and integrating BHoM and Semantic Web can enhance information exchange efficiency in the building industry. To achieve this integration, Buro Happold and the Institute for Computational Design and Construction, Chair for Computing in Architecture (ICD/CA) from the University of Stuttgart, have been working on a joint research project. The work includes research on BHoM and its parallels with Semantic Web Technologies; the translation of the terminological and assertional layer from BHoM to OWL/RDF named bhOWL (and vice-versa) and the integration of bhOWL with design software and graph databases. The graph database integrated with the work receives data from multiple design software disciplines, allowing users to perform cross-database queries. Because both BHoM and bhOWL are prominently dedicated to design, the proposed tool is currently geared towards co-design by designers from various disciplines, such as architects or structural designers. Designers can make better decisions by accessing data from various disciplines. For instance, an acoustic designer might need to know the structural model's ceiling deformation values to determine the best location to place acoustic insulation. Although the tool fulfills the requirements of certain case studies, such as describing building parts and materials, it is still unable to utilise an extensive OWL vocabulary, and the process of reusing existing ontologies is rigid.
