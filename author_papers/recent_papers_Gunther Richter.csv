"Alignment of Multi-Camera Spectral Images Using Wavelet Transform.","2024","I2MTC","Martin Richter, Raik Illmann, Maik Rosenberger, Gunther Notni","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/i2mtc/RichterIRN24","Multispectral imaging is a valuable tool for monitoring plant health in agriculture and forestry. These methods are based on the calculation of different vegetation indices consisting of at least two spectral channels. In order to obtain accurate results, these two images must perfectly overlap. For cost-effective multispectral monitoring of plants with several single-channel cameras, we propose an image alignment technique that utilizes the structure of the scene itself and edge detection by means of wavelet transform. By transforming the spectral images into the frequency domain, we can calculate the average displacements of the scene by determining the distance between the peak amplitudes of the two spectral channels for each image line and axis. Originally, we used the haar wavelet function to extract the frequency domain, which yielded initial good results for vegetation and structures. Other wavelet functions were tested, which allowed further improvements. However, compared to edge extraction with the non-wavelet Sobel operator, only the rbio3.1 wavelet showed improved capabilities in merging the spectral channels, requiring on average one iteration of the proposed algorithm, while maintaining the success rate of Sobel."
"Can Synthetic Images Improve CNN Performance in Wound Image Classification?","2023","MIE","Leila Malihi, Ursula Hübner, Mats L.

Barkhau, Achim Hendriks, Jens Hüsers","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/mie/MalihiHRMPBHHWH23","For artificial intelligence (AI) based systems to become clinically relevant, they must perform well. Machine Learning (ML) based AI systems require a large amount of labelled training data to achieve this level. In cases of a shortage of such large amounts, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are a standard tool for synthesising artificial training images that can be used to augment the data set. We investigated the quality of synthetic wound images regarding two aspects: (i) improvement of wound-type classification by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and (ii) how realistic such images look to clinical experts (n = 217). Concerning (i), results show a slight classification improvement. However, the connection between classification performance and the size of the artificial data set is still unclear. Regarding (ii), although the GAN could produce highly realistic images, the clinical experts took them for real in only 31% of the cases. It can be concluded that image quality may play a more significant role than data size in improving the CNN-based classification result."
