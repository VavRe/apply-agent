"Adaptive Reinforcement Learning for Robot Control.","2024","CoRR","Yu Tang Liu, Nilaksh Singh, Aamir Ahmad","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2404-18713","In this paper, a stable reinforcement learning control approach using neural networks (NNs) is developed for the trajectory tracking of an n-link rigid robot manipulator. The considered systems are in discrete time form. The proposed controller design consists of two NNs. One is the critic network that is used to approximate the long-term cost function, whereas other is that the action NN is employed to generate the system input. Then, an optimal control input can be obtained compared with other robot manipulator systems. Using the Lyapunov approach, the tracking error and weight estimates are proven to be semi-global uniformly ultimately bounded. A simulation example is employed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller."

The advent of sophisticated machine learning techniques now allows the development and implementation of such a method. However, apart from developing a network model that infers animal behavior from video inputs, the key challenge is to obtain sufficient labeled (annotated) data to successfully train that network - a laborious task that needs to be repeated for every species and/or animal system. Here, we propose solutions for both problems, i) a novel methodology for rapidly generating large amounts of annotated data of animals from videos and ii) using it to reliably train deep neural network models to infer the different behavioral states of every animal in each frame of the video. Our method’s workflow is bootstrapped with a relatively small amount of manually-labeled video frames. We develop and implement this novel method by building upon the open-source tool Smarter-LabelMe, leveraging deep convolutional visual detection and tracking in combination with our behavior inference model to quickly produce large amounts of reliable training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on aerial videos of plains and Grévy’s Zebras (Equus quaggaandEquus grevyi). We fully open-source the code1of our method as well as provide large amounts of accurately-annotated video datasets2of zebra behavior using our method.

This can be done using machine learning, specifically Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) which have proven to be effective for prediction tasks. A requisite process before using ANNs as prediction models is its training which is commonly done using back-propagation algorithms. Recently, it has been noticed that swarm intelligence algorithms are better training algorithms for ANNs than backpropagation. In this paper, we propose to employ a high-performing swarm intelligence algorithm, Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) for the training of ANNs applied to the prediction of iPhone sales in Malaysia. Moreover, we propose an optimized Harris Hawks algorithm and apply it for training the same prediction models. Both the original and optimized HHO algorithms are found to be able to better train the prediction models compared to the usual backpropagation algorithm. Furthermore, the proposed optimized HHO algorithm is found to have higher effectiveness than the original HHO as the ANNs trained by the optimized HHO can achieve a root mean square error of 89.6789 during the training as compared to 112.2448 by those trained using the original HHO."

Due to the sensitivity of health data, it is important to secure it against all possible threats. While a great deal of work has been done to secure IoT device-cloud communication and health records on the cloud, insider attacks remain a significant challenge. Malicious insiders may tamper, steal or change patients’ health data, which results in a loss of patient trust in these systems. Audit logs in the cloud, which may point to illegal data access, may also be erased or forged by malicious insiders as they tend to have technical knowledge and privileged access to the system. Thus, in this work, we propose a Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) model that (a) logs every action performed on user data and (b) secures those logs by placing them in a private blockchain that is viewable by the data owners (i.e., patients). Patients can query the blockchain, track their data’s movement, and be alerted if their data has been accessed by an administrator or moved outside the cloud storage. In this work, we practically implement a web application that receives health data from patients, a CASB that securely stores the records in the cloud, and integrate a private blockchain that immediately logs all actions happening in the backend of the web application and CASB. We evaluate the system’s security and performance under varying numbers of patients and actions."

In this work, we present a novel end-to-end deep learning approach for the simultaneous detection of multiple thermal updrafts and the estimation of their properties — a key capability to let autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles soar as well. In contrast to previous works, our approach does not require separate algorithms for the detection of individual updrafts. Instead, a sequence of sensor measurements from a time window of interest can be directly fed into our temporal convolutional network, which estimates the position, strength, and spread of the encountered updrafts. We demonstrated in simulations that our approach can reliably detect updrafts solely based on measurements of the aircraft’s position and the local vertical wind velocity. Nevertheless, our method can additionally make use of measurements of the roll moment induced by updrafts, which improves the precision further. Compared with a particle-filter-based method, we can determine the correct number of encountered updrafts with an accuracy of 99.99% instead of 79.50%, significantly improve the precision of strength as well as spread estimates, and reduce the computational demand."

These hyperparameters exert control over various aspects of the neural network, encompassing feature extraction, spatial resolution, non-linear mapping, convergence speed, and model complexity. We propose a meticulously refined CNN hyperparameter model designed to optimize critical parameters, including filter number and size, stride padding, pooling techniques, activation functions, learning rate, batch size, and the number of layers. Our approach leverages two publicly available brain tumor MRI datasets for research purposes. The first dataset comprises a total of 7,023 human brain images, categorized into four classes: glioma, meningioma, no tumor, and pituitary. The second dataset contains 253 images classified as “yes” and “no.” Our approach delivers exceptional results, demonstrating an average 94.25% precision, recall, and F1-score with 96% accuracy for dataset 1, while an average 87.5% precision, recall, and F1-score, with accuracy of 88% for dataset 2. To affirm the robustness of our findings, we perform a comprehensive comparison with existing techniques, revealing that our method consistently outperforms these approaches. By systematically fine-tuning these critical hyperparameters, our model not only enhances its performance but also bolsters its generalization capabilities. This optimized CNN model provides medical experts with a more precise and efficient tool for supporting their decision-making processes in brain tumor diagnosis."
"Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning in Continuous Control with Successor Feature-Based Concurrent Composition.","2024","ECC","Yu Tang Liu, Aamir Ahmad","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/eucc/LiuA24","Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) frameworks are increasingly used to solve high-dimensional continuouscontrol tasks in robotics. However, due to the lack of sample efficiency, applying DRL for online learning is still practically infeasible in the robotics domain. One reason is that DRL agents do not leverage the solution of previous tasks for new tasks. Recent work on multi-task DRL agents based on successor features (SFs) has proven to be quite promising in increasing sample efficiency. In this work, we present a new approach that unifies two prior multi-task RL frameworks, SF-GPI and value composition, and adapts them to the continuous control domain. We exploit compositional properties of successor features to compose a policy distribution from a set of primitives without training any new policy. Lastly, to demonstrate the multi-tasking mechanism, we present our proof-of-concept benchmark environments, Pointmass and Pointer, based on IsaacGym, which facilitates large-scale parallelization to accelerate the experiments. Our experimental results show that our multi-task agent has single-task performance on par with soft actor-critic (SAC), and the agent can successfully transfer to new unseen tasks.

With the popularity of e-commerce and the expansion of business scale, server load continues to increase, and energy efficiency issues gradually become more prominent. Computation offloading has received widespread attention as a technology that effectively reduces server load. However, how to improve energy efficiency while ensuring computing requirements is an important challenge facing computation offloading. To solve this problem, using non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to increase the efficiency of multi-access wireless transmission, MEC supporting NOMA is investigated in the research. Computing resources will be divided into separate sub-computing that will be handled via e-commerce terminals or transferred to edge sides by reutilizing radio resources, we put forward a Group Switching Matching Algorithm Based on Resource Unit Allocation (GSM-RUA) algorithm that is multi-dimensional. To this end, we first formulate this task allocation problem as a long-term stochastic optimization problem, which we then convert to three short-term deterministic sub-programming problems using Lyapunov optimization, namely, radio resource allocation in a large timescale, computation resource allocating and splitting in a small-time frame. Of the 3 short-term deterministic sub-programming problems, the first sub-programming problem can be remodeled into a 1 to n matching problem, which can be solved using the block-shift-matching-based radio resource allocation method. The latter two sub-programming problems are then transformed into two continuous convex problems by relaxation and then solved easily. We then use simulations to prove that our GSM-RUA algorithm is superior to the state-of-the-art resource management algorithms in terms of energy consumption, efficiency and complexity for e-commerce scenarios."
"Optimizing Transdermal Insulin Delivery: A Simulation Study on the Efficacy of Sonophoretic Transducer Arrays at Low Voltages.","2024","IEEE Access","Sehreen Moorat, Ahsan Ahmad Ursani, Aftab Ahmed Memon, Muhammad Aamir Panhwar","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/access/MooratUMP24","Insulin therapy is integral to the treatment of diabetes mellitus. Epidemiologic studies have shown its benefits both in terms of improving glycemic control and reducing the risk for long-term diabetic complications for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Despite these benefits, barriers to insulin therapy are well documented and include perceived inconvenience, needle anxiety, and portability of device in case of insulin pumps. Therefore, this study aims to design and simulate a low frequency sonophoretic array for transdermal insulin delivery. This study utilizes COMSOL Multiphysics software to simulate the transducer used to increase the skin permeability for delivering drugs. It consists of $8\times 5$ array of a piezoelectric elements operated at 100 kHz and 1 volt. To evaluate the effectiveness of the transducer, an intricate skin model has been developed that includes all anatomical layers extending to the bone. The skin layers, particularly muscle and bone, exhibit reflective properties, leading to the formation of a standing wave. This phenomenon arises from the impedance mismatch between muscle and bone. Standing wave served to promote the transportation of the drug into the dermal layer, rich with capillary networks. We found that applying standing wave with 100 kHz the achieved pressure of 0.3 MPa induced acoustic streaming for the drug flow of $1605~\frac {\mathrm {\mu g}}{{\mathrm {cm}}^{2}}$ per 24 hours. Also, the precise modulation of ultrasound frequency and voltage is key to controlling peak acoustic pressure, thereby regulating the rate of insulin delivery through the skin."
"Reinforcement learning based autonomous multi-rotor landing on moving platforms.","2024","Auton. Robots","Pascal Goldschmid, Aamir Ahmad","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/arobots/GoldschmidA24","Multi-rotor UAVs suffer from a restricted range and flight duration due to limited battery capacity. Autonomous landing on a 2D moving platform offers the possibility to replenish batteries and offload data, thus increasing the utility of the vehicle. Classical approaches rely on accurate, complex and difficult-to-derive models of the vehicle and the environment. Reinforcement learning (RL) provides an attractive alternative due to its ability to learn a suitable control policy exclusively from data during a training procedure. However, current methods require several hours to train, have limited success rates and depend on hyperparameters that need to be tuned by trial-and-error. We address all these issues in this work. First, we decompose the landing procedure into a sequence of simpler, but similar learning tasks. This is enabled by applying two instances of the same RL based controller trained for 1D motion for controlling the multi-rotor’s movement in both the longitudinal and the lateral directions. Second, we introduce a powerful state space discretization technique that is based on i) kinematic modeling of the moving platform to derive information about the state space topology and ii) structuring the training as a sequential curriculum using transfer learning. Third, we leverage the kinematics model of the moving platform to also derive interpretable hyperparameters for the training process that ensure sufficient maneuverability of the multi-rotor vehicle. The training is performed using the tabular RL method Double Q-Learning. Through extensive simulations we show that the presented method significantly increases the rate of successful landings, while requiring less training time compared to other deep RL approaches. Furthermore, for two comparison scenarios it achieves comparable performance than a cascaded PI controller. Finally, we deploy and demonstrate our algorithm on real hardware. For all evaluation scenarios we provide statistics on the agent’s performance. Source code is openly available at https://github.com/robot-perception-group/rl_multi_rotor_landing."

Khan, Naeem Khan, Hong Min, Ayaz Ahmad, Shabir Ahmad","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/access/RashidKKMAA24","Intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) have witnessed a rising interest from researchers because of their promising features. These features include lane change assistance, infotainment, and collision avoidance, among others. To effectively operate ITSs for these functions, there is a need for edge computing. One can install edge computing servers at the roadside units (RSUs). There must be seamless communication between the edge servers and the cars. Additionally, there will be some cars that experience higher delays and thus, are not preferable because they will highly degrade the performance. Therefore, in this work, we consider a vehicular network scenario and define a cost function that takes into account the latency that is determined by the car’s computing frequency, association, and resource allocation while considering fairness constraints. Our cost function is to minimize the total latency (i.e., both local computing latency and transmission latency). The cost of the optimization problem is minimized by optimizing the car’s local frequency allocation, resource allocation, and association. The problem is separable, therefore, we first compute the local frequencies of the cars using a convex optimizer. Next, we split the core problem into two separate problems: (a) the distribution of resources and (b) association, because the last defined problem (joint association and resource allocation) is NP-hard. We then suggest an iterative solution. In the end, we offer numerical findings to support the suggested solution."

A prominent example is 2D pose estimation of animals, particularly wild species like zebras, for which collecting real-world data is complex and impractical. However, many approaches still require real images, consistency and style constraints, sophisticated animal models, and/or powerful pre-trained networks to bridge the syn-to-real gap. Moreover, they often assume that the animal can be reliably detected in images or videos, a hypothesis that often does not hold, e.g. in wildlife scenarios or aerial images. To solve this, we use synthetic data generated with a 3D photorealistic simulator to obtain the first synthetic dataset that can be used for both detection and 2D pose estimation of zebras without applying any of the aforementioned bridging strategies. Unlike previous works, we extensively train and benchmark our detection and 2D pose estimation models on multiple real-world and synthetic datasets using both pre-trained and non-pre-trained backbones. These experiments show how the models trained from scratch and only with synthetic data can consistently generalize to real-world images of zebras in both tasks. Moreover, we show it is possible to easily generalize those same models to 2D pose estimation of horses with a minimal amount of real-world images to account for the domain transfer.

"BERTDom: Protein Domain Boundary Prediction Using BERT.","2023","Comput. Informatics","Ahmad Haseeb, Maryam Bashir, Aamir Wali","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/cai/HaseebBW23",". The domains of a protein provide an insight on the functions that the protein can perform. Delineation of proteins using high-throughput experimental methods is difficult and a time-consuming task. Template-free and sequence-based computational methods that mainly rely on machine learning techniques can be used. However, some of the drawbacks of computational methods are low accuracy and their limitation in predicting different types of multi-domain proteins. Biological language modeling and deep learning techniques can be useful in such situations. In this study, we propose BERTDom for segmenting protein sequences. BERTDOM uses BERT for feature representation and stacked bi-directional long short term memory for classification. We pre-train BERT from scratch on a corpus of protein sequences obtained from UniProt knowledge base with reference clusters. For comparison, we also used two other deep learning architectures: LSTM and feed-forward neural networks. We also experimented with protein-to-vector (Pro2Vec) feature representation that uses word2vec to encode protein bio-words. For testing, three other bench-marked datasets were used. The experimental re-sults on benchmarks datasets show that BERTDom produces the best F-score as compared to other template-based and template-free protein domain boundary prediction methods. Employing deep learning architectures can significantly improve domain boundary prediction. Furthermore, BERT used extensively in NLP for feature representation, has shown promising results when used for encoding bio-words.

Recently, machine learning-based therapeutic agents have gained the attention of researchers due to their high and reliable prediction results. However, the unsatisfactory performance of the existing predictors is due to their high execution cost and minimum predictive results. Therefore, the development of a reliable prediction is highly indispensable for scientists to effectively predict NPs. In this study, we presented an automatic and computationally effective model for identifying of NPs. The evolutionary information is formulated using a bigram position-specific scoring matrix (Bi-PSSM) and K-spaced bigram (KSB). Moreover, for noise reduction, a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is utilized to form Bi-PSSM_DWT and KSB_DWT based high discriminative vectors. In addition, one-hot encoding is also employed to collect sequential features from peptide samples. Finally, a multi-perspective feature set of sequential and embedded evolutionary information is formed. The optimum features are chosen from the extracted features via Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) by evaluating the contribution of the extracted features. The optimal features are trained via six classification models i.e., XGB, ETC, SVM, ADA, FKNN, and LGBM. The predicted labels of these learners are then provided to a genetic algorithm to form an ensemble classification approach. Hence, our model achieved a higher predictive accuracy of 94.47% and 92.55% using training sequences and independent sequences, respectively.

Peptide therapies have emerged as a favorable alternative due to their remarkable specificity in targeting cells without affecting healthy cells. However, the experimental identification methods of anti-tubercular peptides (AtbPs) are labor-intensive and costly. Therefore, accurate prediction of AtbPs has become challenging due to the large number of peptide samples. In this paper, we propose an ensemble learning model to enhance the prediction outcomes by addressing the limitations of individual learning models. We formulate the training samples by utilizing four distinct representation methods: AAindex, Composition/Transition/Distribution, Dipeptide Deviation from Expected Mean, and Enhanced Grouped Amino Acid Composition to numerically encode peptide samples. The feature vectors extracted from these methods are fused to develop a compact vector. We evaluate the prediction rates using three different classification models, employing both individual and heterogeneous vectors. Furthermore, we enhance the prediction and training capabilities of the proposed model by using the predicted labels of the individual classifiers for implementing an ensemble deep model via a genetic algorithm. Through evaluation of both the training datasets and independent datasets, our proposed ensemble learner achieves impressive accuracies of 97.80%, 95.13%, 93.91%, and 94.17%, using RD training, MD training, RD independent, and MD independent datasets, respectively.

To address these problems, device-to-device (D2D) communications based on social relationships can be used, which allow for task-offloading: resource-rich devices share unused computing resources with resource constraint devices. However, unbalanced task offloading in Social IIoT (SIIoT) might actually degrade the overall system performance, which is not desirable. In this paper, we propose an adaptive capacity task offloading solution for D2D-based social industrial IoT (ToSIIoT) which considers devices utilization ratio and strength of social relationships in order to improve resource utilization, increase QoS and achieve better task completion rate. The proposed approach consists of three aspects: social-aware relay selection in a multi-hop D2D communication context, choice of a resource-rich SIIoT device for task offloading, and adaptive redistribution of tasks. The paper proposes heuristic algorithms, as finding optimal solutions to the problems are NP-hard. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed ToSIIoT performs better than existing approaches in terms of utilization ratio, QoS violation, average execution delay, and task completion ratio."

The resulting pressure on the power systems has urged the search for measures to increase the performance of electricity distribution systems by minimizing loss, circumventing overload and reducing cost. The implementation of smart grid systems using artificial intelligence, and combinatorial optimization techniques is one of the ways to improve electricity distribution systems. Power grids including smart grids consist of a number of optimal power flow problems, one of which is the Optimal Reactive Power Dispatch (ORPD) problem. It involves determining the optimal configurations of the grid to curtail its cost. The ORPD problem may be solved by means of optimization algorithms including swarm intelligence algorithms. The Dragonfly Algorithm (DA), a high-performing swarm intelligence algorithm, has been successfully used for solving the ORPD problem. However, the performance of DA can still be amplified by overcoming its limitation of having a low exploitation phase. Previously, an optimized DA algorithm with an improved exploitation phase has been proposed. However, it has not been employed to solve the ORPD problem or to enhance the performance of energy distribution systems. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm by further intensifying the exploitation of the optimized DA. This is carried out by utilizing the steepest ascent hill climbing as a local search method instead of the stochastic hill climbing used in the optimized DA algorithm. The newly introduced algorithm is employed to solve the ORPD problem by making use of standard test cases and based on experimental results, it provides higher quality solutions in comparison to the original DA, the optimized DA, and a modified pathfinder algorithm."

Among these artifacts baseline wandering, electrode movement and muscle artifacts are particularly difficult to remove. Independent component analysis (ICA) is a well-known technique of blind source separation (BSS) and is extensively used in literature for ECG artifact elimination. In this article, the independent vector analysis (IVA) is used for artifact removal in the ECG data. This technique takes advantage of both the canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and the ICA due to the utilization of second-order and high order statistics for un-mixing of the recorded mixed data. The utilization of recorded signals along with their delayed versions makes the IVA-based technique more practical. The proposed technique is evaluated on real and simulated ECG signals and it shows that the proposed technique outperforms the CCA and ICA because it removes the artifacts while altering the ECG signals minimally."

Panda 0001","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/ipps/AnthonyARHSASP23","In recent years, the training requirements of many state-of-the-art Deep Learning (DL) models have scaled beyond the compute and memory capabilities of a single processor, and necessitated distribution among processors. Training such massive models necessitates advanced parallelism strategies [1], [2] to maintain efficiency. However, such distributed DL parallelism strategies require a varied mixture of collective and point-to-point communication operations across a broad range of message sizes and scales. Examples of models using advanced parallelism strategies include Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRM) [3] and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) [4], [5]. Communication libraries’ performance varies wildly across different communication operations, scales, and message sizes. We propose MCR-DL: an extensible DL communication framework that supports all point-to-point and collective operations while enabling users to dynamically mix-and-match communication backends for a given operation without deadlocks. MCR-DL also comes packaged with a tuning suite for dynamically selecting the best communication backend for a given input tensor. We select DeepSpeed-MoE and DLRM as candidate DL models and demonstrate a 31% improvement in DS-MoE throughput on 256 V100 GPUs on the Lassen HPC system. Further, we achieve a 20% throughput improvement in a dense Megatron-DeepSpeed model and a 25% throughput improvement in DLRM on 32 A100 GPUs with the Theta-GPU HPC system."

However, due to the lack of sample efficiency, applying DRL for online learning is still practically infeasible in the robotics domain. One reason is that DRL agents do not leverage the solution of previous tasks for new tasks. Recent work on multi-task DRL agents based on successor features (SFs) has proven to be quite promising in increasing sample efficiency. In this work, we present a new approach that unifies two prior multi-task RL frameworks, SF-GPI and value composition, and adapts them to the continuous control domain. We exploit compositional properties of successor features to compose a policy distribution from a set of primitives without training any new policy. Lastly, to demonstrate the multi-tasking mechanism, we present our proof-of-concept benchmark environments, Pointmass and Pointer, based on IsaacGym, which facilitates large-scale parallelization to accelerate the experiments. Our experimental results show that our multi-task agent has single-task performance on par with soft actor-critic (SAC), and the agent can successfully transfer to new unseen tasks.

Brain tumors are characterized by the abnormal or irregular growth of brain tissues that can spread to nearby tissues and eventually throughout the brain. Although several traditional machine learning and deep learning techniques have been developed for detecting and classifying brain tumors, they do not always provide an accurate and timely diagnosis. This study proposes a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) that leverages the fine-tuning of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to achieve more precise detection of brain tumors. The CGAN comprises two parts, a generator and a discriminator, whose outputs are used as inputs for fine-tuning the CNN model. The publicly available dataset of brain tumor MRI images on Kaggle was used to conduct experiments for Datasets 1 and 2. Statistical values such as precision, specificity, sensitivity, F1-score, and accuracy were used to evaluate the results. Compared to existing techniques, our proposed CGAN model achieved an accuracy value of 0.93 for Dataset 1 and 0.97 for Dataset 2."

"Reinforcement Learning based Autonomous Multi-Rotor Landing on Moving Platforms.","2023","CoRR","Pascal Goldschmid, Aamir Ahmad","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2302-13192","Multi-rotor UAVs suffer from a restricted range and flight duration due to limited battery capacity. Autonomous landing on a 2D moving platform offers the possibility to replenish batteries and offload data, thus increasing the utility of the vehicle. Classical approaches rely on accurate, complex and difficult-to-derive models of the vehicle and the environment. Reinforcement learning (RL) provides an attractive alternative due to its ability to learn a suitable control policy exclusively from data during a training procedure. However, current methods require several hours to train, have limited success rates and depend on hyperparameters that need to be tuned by trial-and-error. We address all these issues in this work. First, we decompose the landing procedure into a sequence of simpler, but similar learning tasks. This is enabled by applying two instances of the same RL based controller trained for 1D motion for controlling the multi-rotor’s movement in both the longitudinal and the lateral directions. Second, we introduce a powerful state space discretization technique that is based on i) kinematic modeling of the moving platform to derive information about the state space topology and ii) structuring the training as a sequential curriculum using transfer learning. Third, we leverage the kinematics model of the moving platform to also derive interpretable hyperparameters for the training process that ensure sufficient maneuverability of the multi-rotor vehicle. The training is performed using the tabular RL method Double Q-Learning. Through extensive simulations we show that the presented method significantly increases the rate of successful landings, while requiring less training time compared to other deep RL approaches. Furthermore, for two comparison scenarios it achieves comparable performance than a cascaded PI controller. Finally, we deploy and demonstrate our algorithm on real hardware. For all evaluation scenarios we provide statistics on the agent’s performance. Source code is openly available at https://github.com/robot-perception-group/rl_multi_rotor_landing."

Black, Aamir Ahmad","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/ral/SainiHBA23","Markerless human motion capture (mocap) from multiple RGB cameras is a widely studied problem. Existing methods either need calibrated cameras or calibrate them relative to a static camera, which acts as the reference frame for the mocap system. The calibration step has to be done a priori for every capture session, which is a tedious process, and re-calibration is required whenever cameras are intentionally or accidentally moved. In this letter, we propose a mocap method which uses multiple static and moving extrinsically uncalibrated RGB cameras. The key components of our method are as follows. First, since the cameras and the subject can move freely, we select the ground plane as a common reference to represent both the body and the camera motions unlike existing methods which represent bodies in the camera coordinate system. Second, we learn a probability distribution of short human motion sequences ($\sim$1 sec) relative to the ground plane and leverage it to disambiguate between the camera and human motion. Third, we use this distribution as a motion prior in a novel multi-stage optimization approach to fit the SMPL human body model and the camera poses to the human body keypoints on the images. Finally, we show that our method can work on a variety of datasets ranging from aerial cameras to smartphones. It also gives more accurate results compared to the state-of-the-art on the task of monocular human mocap with a static camera."

Gilani","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/jifs/WaliANTG23","Deep networks require a considerable amount of training data otherwise these networks generalize poorly. Data Augmentation techniques help the network generalize better by providing more variety in the training data. Standard data augmentation techniques such as flipping, and scaling, produce new data that is a modified version of the original data. Generative Adversarial networks (GANs) have been designed to generate new data that can be exploited. In this paper, we propose a new GAN model, named StynMedGAN for synthetically generating medical images to improve the performance of classification models.  StynMedGAN builds upon the state-of-the-art styleGANv2 that has produced remarkable results generating all kinds of natural images. We introduce a regularization term that is a normalized loss factor in the existing discriminator loss of styleGANv2. It is used to force the generator to produce normalized images and penalize it if it fails. Medical imaging modalities, such as X-Rays, CT-Scans, and MRIs are different in nature, we show that the proposed GAN extends the capacity of styleGANv2 to handle medical images in a better way. This new GAN model (StynMedGAN) is applied to three types of medical imaging: X-Rays, CT scans, and MRI to produce more data for the classification tasks. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model for the classification, 3 classifiers (CNN, DenseNet121, and VGG-16) are used. Results show that the classifiers trained with StynMedGAN-augmented data outperform other methods that only used the original data. The proposed model achieved 100%, 99.6%, and 100% for chest X-Ray, Chest CT-Scans, and Brain MRI respectively. The results are promising and favor a potentially important resource that can be used by practitioners and radiologists to diagnose different diseases."

These come in the form of labelled real-world images and require either a significant amount of human effort, with a high probability of errors such as missing labels, or very constrained scenarios, e.g. VICON systems. On the other hand, uncommon scenarios, like aerial views, animals, like wild zebras, or difficult-to-obtain information, such as human shapes, are hardly available. To overcome this, synthetic data generation with realistic rendering technologies has recently gained traction and advanced research areas such as target tracking and human pose estimation. However, subjects such as wild animals are still usually not well represented in such datasets. In this work, we first show that a pre-trained YOLO detector can not identify zebras in real images recorded from aerial viewpoints. To solve this, we present an approach for training an animal detector using only synthetic data. We start by generating a novel synthetic zebra dataset using GRADE, a state-of-the-art framework for data generation. The dataset includes RGB, depth, skeletal joint locations, pose, shape and instance segmentations for each subject. We use this to train a YOLO detector from scratch. Through extensive evaluations of our model with real-world data from i) limited datasets available on the internet and ii) a new one collected and manually labelled by us, we show that we can detect zebras by using only synthetic data during training.

However, moving objects severely affect core modules of such systems like state estimation and loop closure detection. To address this, dynamic SLAM approaches often use semantic information, geometric constraints, or optical flow to mask features associated with dynamic entities. These are limited by various factors such as a dependency on the quality of the underlying method, poor generalization to unknown or unexpected moving objects, and often produce noisy results, e.g. by masking static but movable objects or making use of predefined thresholds. In this paper, to address these trade-offs, we introduce a novel visual SLAM system, DynaPix, based on per-pixel motion probability values. Our approach consists of a new semantic-free probabilistic pixel-wise motion estimation module and an improved pose optimization process. Our per-pixel motion probability estimation combines a novel static background differencing method on both images and optical flows from splatted frames. DynaPix fully integrates those motion probabilities into both map point selection and weighted bundle adjustment within the tracking and optimization modules of ORB-SLAM2. We evaluate DynaPix against ORB-SLAM2 and DynaSLAM on both GRADE and TUM-RGBD datasets, obtaining lower errors and longer trajectory tracking times. We will release both source code and data upon acceptance of this work."
