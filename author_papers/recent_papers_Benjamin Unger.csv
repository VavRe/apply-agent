"A Joint Approach Towards Data-Driven Virtual Testing for Automated Driving: The AVEAS Project.","2024","CoRR","Leon Eisemann, Mirjam Fehling-Kaschek, Silke Forkert, Andreas Forster, Henrik Gommel, Susanne Guenther, Stephan Hammer, David Hermann, Marvin Klemp, Benjamin Lickert, Florian Lüttner, Robin Moss, Nicole Neis, Maria Pohle, Dominik Schreiber 0004, Cathrina Sowa, Daniel Stadler, Janina Stompe, Michael Strobelt, David Unger, Jens R. Ziehn","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2405-06286","With growing complexity and responsibility of automated driving functions in road traffic and growing scope of their operational design domains, there is increasing demand for covering significant parts of development, validation, and verification via virtual environments and simulation models. If, however, simulations are meant not only to augment real-world experiments, but to replace them, quantitative approaches are required that measure to what degree and under which preconditions simulation models adequately represent reality, and thus allow their usage for virtual testing of driving functions. Especially in research and development areas related to the safety impacts of the""open world"", there is a significant shortage of real-world data to parametrize and/or validate simulations - especially with respect to the behavior of human traffic participants, whom automated vehicles will meet in mixed traffic. This paper presents the intermediate results of the German AVEAS research project (www.aveas.org) which aims at developing methods and metrics for the harmonized, systematic, and scalable acquisition of real-world data for virtual verification and validation of advanced driver assistance systems and automated driving, and establishing an online database following the FAIR principles."
"Balancing-based model reduction for switched descriptor systems.","2024","CoRR","Mattia Manucci, Benjamin Unger","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2404-10511","We present a novel certified model order reduction (MOR) algorithm for switched descriptor systems applicable to large-scale systems. Our algorithm combines the idea of [Hossain \&Trenn, Technical report, 2023] to reformulate the switched descriptor system as a switched ordinary differential equation with jumps and an extension of the balanced truncation for switched ODE from [Pontes Duff et al., IEEE Trans.~Automat.~Control, 2020]. Besides being the first MOR method for switched descriptor systems applicable to the large-scale setting, we give a detailed numerical analysis by incorporating the error in the computation of the system Gramians in the a-priori error bound for the output of the reduced system. In more detail, we demonstrate, theoretically and numerically, that the standard error bound is not applicable, and a certificate must account for the numerical approximation errors."
"Decoupling multistep schemes for elliptic-parabolic problems.","2024","CoRR","Robert Altmann, Abdullah Mujahid, Benjamin Unger","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2407-18594","We study the construction and convergence of decoupling multistep schemes of higher order using the backward differentiation formulae for an elliptic-parabolic problem, which includes multiple-network poroelasticity as a special case. These schemes were first introduced in [Altmann, Maier, Unger, BIT Numer. Math., 64:20, 2024], where a convergence proof for the second-order case is presented. Here, we present a slightly modified version of these schemes using a different construction of related time delay systems. We present a novel convergence proof relying on concepts from G-stability applicable for any order and providing a sharper characterization of the required weak coupling condition. The key tool for the convergence analysis is the construction of a weighted norm enabling a telescoping argument for the sum of the errors."
"Reachable and observable sets for switched systems via generalized Lyapunov equations: application to switched descriptor systems.","2024","CoRR","Mattia Manucci, Benjamin Unger","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2407-20044","In a recent work [Manucci, Unger, ArXiv e-print 2404.10511, 2024], the authors propose using two generalized Lyapunov equations (GLEs) to derive a balancing-based model order reduction~(MOR) method for a general class of switched differential-algebraic equations (DAEs). This work explains why these GLEs provide solutions suitable for MOR by showing that the image set of the solutions of the two GLEs always encloses the reachable and observable set of a suitably defined switched system with the same input to output map of the switched DAE system."
"Upper limb movement quality measures: comparing IMUs and optical motion capture in stroke patients performing a drinking task.","2024","Frontiers Digit.

Luft, Roger Gassert, Olivier Lambercy, Chris Awai Easthope, Josef G. Schönhammer","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/fdgth/UngerRMWPSHSKGLGLES24","Introduction Clinical assessment of upper limb sensorimotor function post-stroke is often constrained by low sensitivity and limited information on movement quality. To address this gap, recent studies proposed a standardized instrumented drinking task, as a representative daily activity combining different components of functional arm use. Although kinematic movement quality measures for this task are well-established, and optical motion capture (OMC) has proven effective in their measurement, its clinical application remains limited. Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) emerge as a promising low-cost and user-friendly alternative, yet their validity and clinical relevance compared to the gold standard OMC need investigation. Method In this study, we conducted a measurement system comparison between IMUs and OMC, analyzing 15 established movement quality measures in 15 mild and moderate stroke patients performing the drinking task, using five IMUs placed on each wrist, upper arm, and trunk. Results Our findings revealed strong agreement between the systems, with 12 out of 15 measures demonstrating clinical applicability, evidenced by Limits of Agreement (LoA) below the Minimum Clinically Important Differences (MCID) for each measure. Discussion These results are promising, suggesting the clinical applicability of IMUs in quantifying movement quality for mildly and moderately impaired stroke patients performing the drinking task."
"Control of port-Hamiltonian differential-algebraic systems and applications.","2023","Acta Numer.","Volker Mehrmann, Benjamin Unger","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/actanum/MehrmannU23","The modeling framework of port-Hamiltonian descriptor systems and their use in numerical simulation and control are discussed. The structure is ideal for automated network-based modeling since it is invariant under power-conserving interconnection, congruence transformations, and Galerkin projection. Moreover, stability and passivity properties are easily shown. Condensed forms under orthogonal transformations present easy analysis tools for existence, uniqueness, regularity, and numerical methods to check these properties. After recalling the concepts for general linear and nonlinear descriptor systems, we demonstrate that many difficulties that arise in general descriptor systems can be easily overcome within the port-Hamiltonian framework. The properties of port-Hamiltonian descriptor systems are analyzed, time-discretization, and numerical linear algebra techniques are discussed. Structure-preserving regularization procedures for descriptor systems are presented to make them suitable for simulation and control. Model reduction techniques that preserve the structure and stabilization and optimal control techniques are discussed. The properties of port-Hamiltonian descriptor systems and their use in modeling simulation and control methods are illustrated with several examples from different physical domains. The survey concludes with open problems and research topics that deserve further attention."
"Higher-order iterative decoupling for poroelasticity.","2023","CoRR","Robert Altmann, Abdullah Mujahid, Benjamin Unger","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2311-14400","For the iterative decoupling of elliptic-parabolic problems such as poroelasticity, we introduce time discretization schemes up to order $5$ based on the backward differentiation formulae. Its analysis combines techniques known from fixed-point iterations with the convergence analysis of the temporal discretization. As main result, we show that the convergence depends on the interplay between the time step size and the parameters for the contraction of the iterative scheme. Moreover, this connection is quantified explicitly, which allows for balancing the single error components. Several numerical experiments illustrate and validate the theoretical results, including a three-dimensional example from biomechanics."
"Model Reduction on Manifolds: A differential geometric framework.","2023","CoRR","Patrick Buchfink, Silke Glas, Bernard Haasdonk, Benjamin Unger","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2312-01963","Using nonlinear projections and preserving structure in model order reduction (MOR) are currently active research fields. In this paper, we provide a novel differential geometric framework for model reduction on smooth manifolds, which emphasizes the geometric nature of the objects involved. The crucial ingredient is the construction of an embedding for the low-dimensional submanifold and a compatible reduction map, for which we discuss several options. Our general framework allows capturing and generalizing several existing MOR techniques, such as structure preservation for Lagrangian- or Hamiltonian dynamics, and using nonlinear projections that are, for instance, relevant in transport-dominated problems. The joint abstraction can be used to derive shared theoretical properties for different methods, such as an exact reproduction result. To connect our framework to existing work in the field, we demonstrate that various techniques for data-driven construction of nonlinear projections can be included in our framework."
"Port-Hamiltonian Dynamic Mode Decomposition.","2023","SIAM J. Sci. Comput.","Riccardo Morandin, Jonas Nicodemus, Benjamin Unger","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/siamsc/MorandinNU23","We present a novel physics-informed system identification method to construct a passive linear time-invariant system. In more detail, for a given quadratic energy functional, measurements of the input, state, and output of a system in the time domain, we find a realization that approximates the data well while guaranteeing that the energy functional satisfies a dissipation inequality. To this end, we use the framework of port-Hamiltonian (pH) systems and modify the dynamic mode decomposition, respectively operator inference, to be feasible for continuous-time pH systems. We propose an iterative numerical method to solve the corresponding least-squares minimization problem. We construct an effective initialization of the algorithm by studying the least-squares problem in a weighted norm, for which we present the analytical minimum-norm solution. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated with several numerical examples."
