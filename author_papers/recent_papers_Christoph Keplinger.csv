"Hexagonal electrohydraulic modules for rapidly reconfigurable high-speed robots.","2024","Sci. Robotics","Zachary Yoder, Ellen H. Rumley, Ingemar Schmidt, Philipp Rothemund, Christoph Keplinger","Journal Articles","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/scirobotics/YoderRSRK24","Robots made from reconfigurable modular units feature versatility, cost efficiency, and improved sustainability compared with fixed designs. Reconfigurable modules driven by soft actuators provide adaptable actuation, safe interaction, and wide design freedom, but existing soft modules would benefit from high-speed and high-strain actuation, as well as driving methods well-suited to untethered operation. Here, we introduce a class of electrically actuated robotic modules that provide high-speed (a peak contractile strain rate of 4618% per second, 15.8-hertz bandwidth, and a peak specific power of 122 watts per kilogram), high-strain (49% contraction) actuation and that use magnets for reversible mechanical and electrical connections between neighboring modules, thereby serving as building blocks for rapidly reconfigurable and highly agile robotic systems. The actuation performance of each hexagonal electrohydraulic (HEXEL) module is enabled by a synergistic combination of soft and rigid components; a hexagonal exoskeleton of rigid plates amplifies the motion produced by soft electrohydraulic actuators and provides a mechanical structure and connection platform for reconfigurable robots composed of many modules. We characterize the actuation performance of individual HEXEL modules, present a model that captures their quasi-static force-stroke behavior, and demonstrate both a high-jumping and a fast pipe-crawling robot. Using embedded magnetic connections, we arranged multiple modules into reconfigurable robots with diverse functionality, including a high-stroke muscle, a multimodal active array, a table-top active platform, and a fast-rolling robot. We further leveraged the magnetic connections for hosting untethered, snap-on driving electronics, together highlighting the promise of HEXEL modules for creating rapidly reconfigurable high-speed robots. Soft and rigid materials combine for high-speed and high-strain modules that magnetically connect into reconfigurable robots. Editor’s summary Reconfigurable, modular robots are an appealing approach to developing versatile systems, but because of soft actuators’ slow actuation speeds, low force output, and tethered configurations, they have mostly been limited to heavy, bulky motors. Using electrohydraulic actuation, Yoder et al. developed a hexagonal-shaped modular robot that provides high-speed and high-strain actuation. Four electrohydraulic actuators located at the junctions of a hexagonal array of stiff plates drive a rapid shape change in the hexagon from tall and narrow to wide and short. Magnets embedded in the plates allow the modules to connect in honeycomb-like lattices for multimodal actuation, such as a high-stroke muscle hanging configuration and a rolling wheel–like configuration. —Melisa Yashinski"
"Fulfilling Industrial Needs for Consistency Among Engineering Artifacts.","2023","ICSE-SEIP","Luciano Marchezan, Wesley K. G. Assunção, Edvin Herac, Felix Keplinger, Alexander Egyed, Christophe Lauwerys","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/icse/MarchezanAHKEL23","Maintaining the consistency of engineering artifacts is a challenge faced by several engineering companies. This is more evident when the engineering artifacts are created using different tools and have different formats. This is the context of a company that builds agricultural machines, where components are developed using a decentralized iterative process. In this study, we present an approach developed in collaboration with an industry partner to address the issues and requirements of a real engineering scenario. These issues include the manual execution of consistency checking, without guidelines that formalize the activity. Furthermore, the industry partner aims at a flexible solution that can be applied without disrupting the current development process significantly. The proposed approach applies consistency rules (CR) defined to automatically detect and provide inconsistency feedback to engineers in real-time. The approach presented in this work also allows the customization of the CRs, giving flexibility to how the consistency checking is applied. The feasibility of our approach is demonstrated in such an industrial scenario, with a discussion about how the issues were addressed and the limitations of the current solution. We also perform a scalability evaluation showing that the approach can be applied in large systems (up to 21,061 elements) in a reasonable amount of time, taking less than 0.25 milliseconds to apply a CR, in the worst cases."
