"Modular Growth of Hierarchical Networks: Efficient, General, and Robust Curriculum Learning.","2024","CoRR","Mani Hamidi, Sina Khajehabdollahi, Emmanouil Giannakakis, Tim Jakob Schäfer, Anna Levina, Charley M. Wu","Informal and Other Publications","https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2406-06262","Structural modularity is a pervasive feature of biological neural networks, which have been linked to several functional and computational advantages. Yet, the use of modular architectures in artificial neural networks has been relatively limited despite early successes. Here, we explore the performance and functional dynamics of a modular network trained on a memory task via an iterative growth curriculum. We find that for a given classical, non-modular recurrent neural network (RNN), an equivalent modular network will perform better across multiple metrics, including training time, generalizability, and robustness to some perturbations. We further examine how different aspects of a modular network's connectivity contribute to its computational capability. We then demonstrate that the inductive bias introduced by the modular topology is strong enough for the network to perform well even when the connectivity within modules is fixed and only the connections between modules are trained. Our findings suggest that gradual modular growth of RNNs could provide advantages for learning increasingly complex tasks on evolutionary timescales, and help build more scalable and compressible artificial networks."
"Predictive, scalable and interpretable knowledge tracing on structured domains.","2024","ICLR","Hanqi Zhou, Robert Bamler, Charley M. Wu, Álvaro Tejero-Cantero","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/iclr/ZhouBWT24","Intelligent tutoring systems optimize the selection and timing of learning materials to enhance understanding and long-term retention. This requires estimates of both the learner's progress (''knowledge tracing''; KT), and the prerequisite structure of the learning domain (''knowledge mapping''). While recent deep learning models achieve high KT accuracy, they do so at the expense of the interpretability of psychologically-inspired models. In this work, we present a solution to this trade-off. PSI-KT is a hierarchical generative approach that explicitly models how both individual cognitive traits and the prerequisite structure of knowledge influence learning dynamics, thus achieving interpretability by design. Moreover, by using scalable Bayesian inference, PSI-KT targets the real-world need for efficient personalization even with a growing body of learners and learning histories. Evaluated on three datasets from online learning platforms, PSI-KT achieves superior multi-step predictive accuracy and scalable inference in continual-learning settings, all while providing interpretable representations of learner-specific traits and the prerequisite structure of knowledge that causally supports learning. In sum, predictive, scalable and interpretable knowledge tracing with solid knowledge mapping lays a key foundation for effective personalized learning to make education accessible to a broad, global audience."
"Compositionality under time pressure.","2023","CogSci","Valerio Rubino, Mani Hamidi, Peter Dayan, Charley M. Wu","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/cogsci/RubinoHDW23","Compositionality is a central component of the human faculty for generalization and flexibility. However, the computations involved are poorly understood, especially in terms of their cognitive costs. On one hand, compositionality requires searching combinatorially large hypothesis spaces, raising issues of tractability.On the other hand, compositional representations afford efficient and compact compression. To shed light on the cognitive resource required for compositionality, we used a within-subject time pressure manipulation to study how participants navigated a series of mazes, generated using recursive operations over spatial primitives. We find evidence that behavior is guided by the use of primitives and abstract operations over them, where the degree of compositional structure increases performance and speeds up decisions.And while time pressure led to more random errors, it did not impair the capacity for compositionality. Rather, participants increased their reliance on reusing and recombining previous computations, suggesting a remarkable robustness of human compositional reasoning."

"Environment-sensitive generalization and exploration strategies.","2023","CogSci","Fien Ruth Goetmaeckers, Charley M. Wu, Tom Verguts, Senne Braem","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/cogsci/GoetmaeckersWVB23","When faced with many options to choose from, humans and other agents typically need to explore the utility of new choice options. People with an autism diagnosis or elevated autism traits are thought to avoid exploring such unknown options. In a large sample (N = 588), we investigated the impact of autism diagnosis or elevated autism traits on exploration behavior during value-based decision-making in vast decision spaces. Our findings show that participants with an autism diagnosis were less likely to explore novel choice options and more likely to exploit known high-value options. Computational modeling suggests they engaged in less uncertainty-driven exploration but exhibited equal random exploration and generalization strategies. Interestingly, among non-diagnosed participants, people with elevated autism traits did not explore less. Our findings highlight important differences in exploration strategies between clinical and subclinical populations."
"Social learning with a grain of salt.","2023","CogSci","Alexandra Witt, Wataru Toyokawa, Kevin N. Lala, Wolfgang Gaissmaier, Charley M. Wu","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/cogsci/WittTLGW23","Humans are remarkably effective social learners, with several recent studies formalizing this capacity using computational models. However, previous research has often been limited to tasks where observer and demonstrator share the same reward function. In contrast, humans can learn from others who have different preferences, skills, or goals. To study social learning under individual differences, we introduce the socially correlated bandit, where participants have personalized rewards, which are correlated with but not identical to those of others. Social information can still be useful, but not when used verbatim. We present a model of Social Generalization that integrates individual and social information into the generalization process, but assumes social information to be noisier and thus less informative. This model out-competes previous models, with it being the dominant strategy in evolutionary simulations. Our findings expand on previous models of social learning, showing humans can integrate social information more flexibly than previously assumed."
